What the heck
It took me so long to finish this book because it was soooo boring. Like I’m sorry … I love the concept but it was boring in a way it wasn’t supposed to be. I liked it in the beginning and I loved luke but I think it’s the way it was written because I got bored so quickly did no reason.
It was nice book. Not too slow though I wish there was more Day pov than June. It’s not that I didn’t like it just that she realised he was innocent too late and basically stood by his downfall. But it was okay :)
It was amazing. I loved it! I loved it so much. The way it was written, the concept, the characters and the grumpy with sunshine thing. I loved it.But than again. There was too much height difference. It was kinda annoying. And I would’ve overseen it when it was just “he’s tall” or “I couldn’t see anything because of his body right in front of me” anything that indicates indirectly to his height. Buuuuuit no no no.Let me give you one of the examples. The worst one is “the man inhaled sharply and inclined his head a tiny bit, making olive feel less like a squirrel monkey climbing a baobab tree” like excuse me. Is this just like the hating game. Comparing ourselves with animals. -_-Now some less weird examples “He’s a tall, broody, sullen hunk with an genius IQ” another one “she found Adam very quickly, he’s big after all” another one “he was so much larger than him” blah blah blah. I can keep going on. I have about too many of these pink stickers indicating the height difference moments. Though I don’t mind because the book was amazing, it was tiring. But of course, my favourite line was “I’m going to kill you’ he gritted out a little more than a growl ‘if you ever say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her, I’m going to fucking kill you!” I loved that line. Loved it :)
** spoiler alert ** I give this 4.5 stars, purely because it was quite boring for the first 80/100 pages. But I loved the rest. Though I have a few things to say. America did 100% not deserve Maxon. Throughout the story, I had gotten used to her having Aspen as her back up. But when her older sister Kenna had said “you’re better than that” blah blah blah “you’re seriously using Aspen as a safety net for if this don’t go your way” That was when I was like, shiiiiii she was doing that. Very low of her and not okay. But when Maxon found out about them … damnnn. I hated her for those moments, mostly when I was reading the letters. Because no fucking way that America was thinking of Maxon and Aspen while maxon was absolutely smitten with her. Like I’m sorry, excuse you for that.When he finally was acting like a badass at the end, I was so proud of him. I was like “yeahhhh you tell her” But honestly, I cannot even try to understand why he still married her. Like … she basically cheating on you and if you wanted, you could get her rightfully killed for it. If he wanted. But honestly it would be a bit much. But still. When he was like “lose me? When I am going to let you go home you still have a husband (aspen) you have a high caste, you have a home blah blah blah. But what would I have!?” Like that hit a little too close. AND HE STILL MARRIED HER! AND INSTEAD OF HIM CRYING, SHE WAS SOBBING LIKE A BABY WHILE SHE WRONGED HIMMMMMM!Like I said, she does not deserve him. But I did like it. I am so sad so many people died. The worst of them all would be Celeste. Her character development was incredible and I loved her! I loved her! She was amazing. Also queen amberly. She’ll never be able to be called mom by her daughter now … which is sad. But I’m happy the King died. He deserved to die. Happy bout it too. :) Btw. I love Georgia and August <3
I was screaming and crying and it was amazing and I loved and there was too much for me actually handle but I did anyways and I loved it. Totally recommend the cruel prince series. It was amazing. Not just the way it written, the characters the plots. Everything! I love it
It was good with a nice plot. Though I do think that if he did cheat I wouldn’t have given him a second chance because hd knew how sad she was all along and miscommunication was again, one of the things that kept apart. Which is kinda sad. I was not on the edge of seat all the time, because it was kinda predictable at some points I wouldn’t read it again but it was s find book. It was more sad so if want something more romantic, maybe you should af other books :)
It was a good book. I don’t have much to say except for that it mostly was a good book and a few other things. 1. Maxon is getting hate from America because of the fact that he kissed Celeste and all and that he is growing closer with the other girls because she isn’t ready. Like … aren’t u meeting up aspen and kissing him. Kinda unfair if you ask me. 2. That dumbass presentation. Like … do u wanna get killed something. I said this before in my review of the selection and I’ll say it again. This girl is suicidal and she is acting upon it. Like stop. 3. MAKE A FUCKKNG DECISION! it’s not that hard. ChoosooseeeerBut it was good. And I hope that the one is going to be better :)
It was an amazing again, expected nothing less from the holly black. I loved it and I would read it again. Tragic end of course but I bet in the queen of nothing m, everything will be better. :) would recommend
Warner. That’s all. It’s all Warner now. No Adam. Nothing. Just Warner. I cried a little bit while reading because he’s misunderstood, and purely because we saw how he acted with Juliette through her eyes doesn’t mean the way she thought of him were also his intentions. I am not saying that his actions get to excused. No no. He did what he did and it’s not okay. But we have to be reasonable.
I liked it, I did. I’d give it a 4 stars. And it nice. I laughed and it was romantic and it was nice to read. I finished it quite fast. And it was just easy to read. But But but but There’s somethings I have a say of. 1. The names. Who. In the absolute back of the secret of chambers. Made up these stupid ass names. Maxon I could understand somewhere. But sosie, tiny, emmica, bariel and worst of all Aspen. I do not understand why. Just why. 2. Why would she, a natural beauty and a girl who isn’t like the other girls, go for a man while a very very fragile masculinity. Like … she brings him food for his family because she can and he’s like “nah nah, imma leave you right now purely because I’m the man and I need to provide for everyone and if needed, I’ll take on extra jobs even though I’m like super tired and sick of everything. I’ll do it” like … maxon would provide her with everything she needs if she wants to ofc. He is understanding and is willing to wait on her blah blah blah and than she gets all stupid and said shit like “nah I don’t choose either of you I choose me” like … stfu plsAnd 3. WHY the hell would she kiss aspen knowing damn well it could get them both killed … like tf. Calm down girl. If ya suicidal just say so. No need to act upon it. But besides that, and the fact she’s an indecisive trashy hoe. I loved the book :)I would recommend :)
I think this was one of the lesser books of the shatter me series until now. She had apparently killed 600 people which I thought was badass, but she wasn’t very present in the book this time, Juliette. Instead, loads of others were introduced which I liked of course but it was messy and a lot of drama was going on. I give it a 3.5 but it was fun to read most parts. But some just weren’t doing it for me. The miscommunication again, which I totally hated. He didn’t tell her anything which made her curious and when she found out, she got angry. She also got drunk and shaved her head and I was a little confused at first but than she felt sooooo badass so I thought nothing of it. I didn’t like it, because it was so random. And this whole book was basically based on the romantics and her being shot and sick and than Nezeera (the baddest of them all and my fav) and kenji had their thing. And I loved it but than again. She betrayed them. Blah blah blah. I loved it but it was tooooo dramatic and tooooo much miscommunication. ;) I do hope defy me will be better :)
Powerful woman and queens are everything in a book. I loved it. Totally loved it! It was amazing and good to read. Like I actually enjoyed reading it and found it a shame when I had to put it down. I did get trust issues :) sooooooo✨ that’s amazing.But it you want to sit at the edge when reading a book, this your book.
I give it a 4.5 stars. The reason is that this is an insanely good book. It was written well. The way everything had a link together was amazing. I had only realised it later when all other kinds of pov’s appeared in the story. I loved it and thought it was incredibly neatly done. Some parts were a bit cringe … but there was lots of romance and I loved it.I would recommend :)
No. Just no. I mean- I actually read this a long time ago, but when I did, I was just weirded out when I was done. I mean— the spice level was like 2.5. Nothing special. It was over hyped, very overhyped. Also, the characters were just not doing it for me. There was nothing special. And I guess it’s not all Penelope’s fault, it could have been good, maybe like 3 stars, but because it was so overhyped I had high expectations. So I was really let down :/
I liked this book a lot. It was good and really trilling. But. I liked Logan’s pov so much more and I think that’s because he’s like creepy and such and I have a liking to that mostly. Buuuutttt idk about Delilah. When I first read her pov, I wanted to read more about it, but than I kinda got sick of her and wanted more of Logan.But I still loved it. It was fun to read.
O. M. G. This is officially the best book in the whole shatter me series. I love it! Okay, I love the big ass plot and the fact that there is romance and blah blah blahI love it! And I would read ig again. It’s so different. And idk, compared to all the other books, it just seems so amazing. Like this was s different book. You can see the author really put her time in it. And omg! The only reason Anderson hates Juliette was because no matter how many time they erased their memories, they always fell in love with each other. They were always attracted, like magnets. And that’s the one and only explanation to soulmates. They are true soulmates.
DAMN. Okay, let’s discard the fact that she might just be somewhat distant and tends to push people away, let’s discard that and just look at the story. She’s depressed and obviously needs help, but she doesnt want actual help, she wants people to figure it out, but doesn’t want them to really find out. Goodness— this was amazing. I loved it so much. It just spoke so much about how most teeenager feel. Not to mention that if we don’t discard it all, it still had those wholesome moments. It wants just all darkness and dull moments, it was amazing. 10 out of 10, totally recommend. Partly because I could relate and partly because I like listening to other peoples stories, not the exterior, but the interior, how’d they feel, why and what made them do stuff. I guess that it just made the book even better. Can’t wait for the rest. I did listen to the audiobook, which I must say, was an even better experience. I tried to hide my little dramatic gasps, but it was such a good experience.
** spoiler alert ** I rate it 3.5 purely because I bought it for the horror … and there was almost little to no horror. There was plot and a lot of romance … but not much horror. Which was a shame, but then again, it is Colleen Hoover, what else did I really expect. :)The thing is, there were some moment were my mouth was touching the floor and I was completely baffled. Some things I had realised after I finished it and some were just during the reading time where I just put it down. (Yes this is one of those books where you still think of it even after you have read it) 1. Why were characters so hollow. There was, again, lots and lots of trauma. Yet I didn’t seem to feel sorry one bit for them. Like … Jeremy who lost 2 children, yet I didn’t sorry for him because when it was explained that his children died, there was nothing that said to me “how sad”. Like I didn’t care. Though I know if written differently, I would have cared. Also with lowen, it just seemed as if having your mother die a year later while she lived with you and battling cancer was normal. Having 2 children dead was normal. Having absolutely no normal relationships in your life was normal. It just seemed so normal that there was place for sadness or pity. 2. Why did I at one moment just want to skip all Lowen parts and just keep on reading the manuscript. The manuscript was absolutely amazing, they were written with anger, something that is easily read and pretty understandable. But when the chapter of the manuscript ended … Lowen’s chapter started and I just wanted to put it down. 3. It didn’t make much sense at one moment. The whole thing was perfect and though I was supposed to hate verity, I loved her most. So until page 297 everything was fine. And then the letters came. For no reason did Colleen hoover think that giving that plot would be funny. But I think that it was just that she wanted to write more but didn’t know what she should write. So she thought that making verity seem innocent and turning the whole story around by saying she was just writing it because of her agent Amanda … but Colleen hoover let some gaps in it. - we can establish that she wrote it off things that really happened and just wrote it in the pov of a villain because of her books. But. If everything did happen, why does the letters say that the canoe tipped and she tried to save them but since harper was found under the net, she died. If that is true, why did she tell crew to hold his breath. And if that were to seem untrue, why did Jeremy on that night especially ask her “why did you tell crew to hold his breath” … Not only that, but why didn’t she put a warning on her manuscript. ? I just don’t understand. And another thing, why, if the letters were true, if verity truly wanted to run away with crew because his father was dangerous, then why did crew have a knife? Why did he have a knife in her room under the wooden boards, and why did verity write the letters only after Low arrived? Why didn’t she apologise before. Because she wanted to stay with her husband for the rest of her live like a vegetable that got struck by lightning. And if she didn’t try to force an abortion because of her dumb feeling of jealousy that her unborn children got more attention that she herself, if she didn’t truly felt that way for an abortion, how did chastin get her scar? Doctors said it could be because the other twin scratched her but if the manuscript was based on real events and just fake thoughts and different writing, then she must still have done that. Idk … and I guess no one else will ever know. 5. Low is crazy. We have established that throughout the book. But the thing that showed low and verity were on the same level, was on 2 occasions. It just showed she was crazy. - when she just did the dirty with Jeremy and he left to go upstairs and she put a pillow under her hips so his insides wouldn’t seep out … that was kinda crazy. Like she wanted to be connected, forced or by love, knowing he has a obvious soft spot for children, by getting pregnant. Smart … but manipulative. Then the other time she found the letters. Read that Jeremy obviously tried to kill verity and yet she ripped the pieces that wrote his name and ate them … yeah I was baffled. SHE ATE THE PAPER! Like she could’ve flushed it, but no, why do that, let’s have a meal above the toilet. She flushed the rest but felt the need to eat the Other pieces. And she still loves him even after the “truth” Really crazy if you ask me. It was still a good book. I would recommend if you like romance but you expect horror, go find another book. <3
I give it 3.5 stars. It was fun read. But it was just a little boring in the beginning. The first 200 to 250 pages were just about her life and it was really fast paced tbh. And actually I didn’t mind that much since it was easy to read but I liked it. And I am happy I didn’t give up because it was worth it in the end. The last 100 pages deserve an award. Thought it’s s big much of a drop at once. I liked it lots. I even cried a little. It was good and I would recommend it.
Adam kent. He’s pretty much just a bitch. I don’t like him. In all the previous books I’ve read, I never liked him. And I don’t think I will. The only reason I am tolerating him still, it’s purely because of James. James is amazing. He’s a little angel and Kenji and James are the perfect duo. I love James and kenji, but Adam is a dick :)I still do recommend reading the shatter me series. It’s amazing but Adam is pissing me off :)
Damn, it was really good. I listened to the audio book, so it was like she was just telling me the tale of her life. Really good. I recommend the audio book 100%
I give it 4.5 stars. It was good, nicely written and fun to read. But honestly, the way some characters were written I had totally expected something else. Idk. Like branden. He was really nice and all and he was one of the hot and not toxic guys who were explained in detail. I was a bit put off when she just kept going for Adam and Warner. It was sad and I expected differently but I liked the book. Still team Warner
I loved it, purely because it was kenji’s head I was in. I loved it! And I was shocked on some parts of course, 600 people weren’t alive. Nezeera is a traitor, but not really. Idk
I give this a 3.5 It was a good book and I loved all the new shit and all … but the main character… she changed dramatically. She was really selfish most of the time and I get that she found her worth but she has to show even the tiniest bit oc humbleness. That maybe would make it better. I got quite a bit annoyed by it. She got what she deserved and I hope kings cage got something more for me because I love maven. And btw, the way she was reading little paper sheets of maven congratulating his bother and she just keeps it to herself … 😬Yeah no. I would recommend, since there were fun parts in it and all, but there were some things where I just cringed and was like … nahhhh. But tbh it wasn’t that baddddd I think :)
AMAZING AMAZING AND AMAZING! I tell you, read this. MWill your mental health get a little toll on it? Yeah.Will be be worth it? TOTALLY. I had thought this book would’ve been like any other, and I was so wrong. It was amazing and I couldn’t put it down. I am going to read it again because it’s just so amazing.No regrets of buying this and I cannot wait until October 18th this year when it’s starts with us comes out since atlas had only been shown little of his present life :)
It’s my absolute favorite book. I’m sorry. I know some people have things to say about it. But honestly, can you really hate on this book other than that’s it’s not you’re type of book you’d usually read. These letters. The trauma. The love. The fact he’s sees instead of talks. The observations he makes. The way he cries at everything because of trauma. The fact that he’s not totally okay and other people know that. The fact that he did drugs and drank alcohol because of participation. The fact that he never got caught except on smoking. The fact that he was so happy to have friends. The fact that he was so sad that he apparently did something wrong. The fact he knows when he messes up.All of this makes The Perks Of Being A Wallflower so much better. I liked it a lot. I haven’t even mentioned the way that it’s written.I love the letter thing so much. I can only imagine how hard that must’ve been in certain aspects. But the author did an amazing job. Also, his improvements. He went from writing like an actual 15 year old to writing with more punctuation. Truly, I saw the improvements and it was really nice to notice. The poem was nice and I understood it only later which was even better. The stories from him when he was smaller were nice and all of his friends were portrayed to be so nice though I bet that in any other pov, they wouldn’t be. It’s just another thing I like about this book. It’s nice. It’s realistic and understandable. 10/10 would definitely recommend.
I LOVED THIS BOOK. if made me cry a bit … yup. I loved it. The details were amazing and so good on all of it. I don’t know if I can watch the movie because I know it will disappoint me badly so I’ll keep it to the book. But really, go read this book instead of watching the movie. It’s so much more detailed and lovelier.
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE. The way it was written the characters the language the idea. IG WAS AMAZING. I love Jude! I love her so much. We finally have a main character who is a bad bitch and amazing. I love it.It’s perfect perfect perfect Recommend to anyone :)
I really like this book. I think that until this might be my favourite of the shatter me series. The reason is simple. I love romance books, and this action a little bit but mostly romance.Of course I understand that Adam had needed to made to look bad and all, just for Warner and Juliette to get together. I indeed never really liked Adam and I still don’t. I am happy they are all getting character development. Mostly Warner, Juliette on the other hand is just out there making scenes and acting like she’s the main character in that war (and though she technically is, there are others in need for help and she doesn’t quite see it as good). Though I love her bad this series, I must say that there are things that could be bettered. Stop talking about how godly looking Warner is … like. I get it. I’m on ur side and all but calm down. Stop making these weird metaphors. When something very exciting is about to happen, she is breaking it off by making up metaphors. Like I don’t care about soil and trees or blah blah blah, I just want to know what is happening. But other than that, I totally loved this book :) I recommend reading the series.
Umh. I give it a 4.5 purely because it was a good book. There was a plot and romance and action. Lots and lots of action. I like it.Buttttt You can tell this book was rushed. She didn’t write this one as she did with the others. It was good, but I don’t love it. I didn’t get the rush I always get, but I did get relief. Relief for I finally finished this serie. :)I would recommend you to read this serie. I did like the time I spent reading it and it was pretty damn good :)
Again. Really amazing, reason, because it’s kenji. You can’t hate Kenji
I loved this book. I would recommend this to anyone. It’s good and honestly, not just the way it was written, not just the way things were striped out and all. It’s the thoughts that do it for me.I know she’s in insane and some authors don’t pull it off the make the character actually seem insane. But Taheri Mafi. DAMN. She did it. And she did it amazingly Btw. I am team Warner. Even though he’s kind of an ass and all, I will be team Warner until the end <3 This isn’t the first book I had read but when I say that I got tears mid-book. I mean it. Usually I get it around the end. But no. Not this book.Loved it
I loved it once more. It just shows how amazing holly black is. She makes me love every book the cruel prince series. I love it and even though you could read as a single when you haven’t read the cruel prince series yet, I wouldn’t recommend it. It was amazing because I knew why he did certain things and I would totally recommend reading the cruel prince series. absolutely amazing :)
I mean- I read it for school … it was good I guess. Except that it had no story line and it had a reallllyyyyyy rough language. The MC was had a lack of love in his life which was sad I guess, but I can’t help but not have a very clear opinion on this book.It was written with very blunt descriptions about people and he also had no remorse to be blunt to people such as his mom, his only girlfriend ever, his friends ect. His took the people in his life for granted and told them things without thinking, he lost almost everybody.It’s a sad book and it was easy to read. But yeah- as I said- I just cannot find a very clear way to react to this book.
It was a cheesy book, a bit cringe and a whole lot of height difference. I get that height is a big part when someone is very tall in comparison to you but that doesn’t explain your whole personality. I wasn’t even at a quarter of the book and I had already seen too many pieces of things like “omg he’s so tall and godly and I’m so short” blah blah blah. Like boo boo girl. Go cry about it or something. The worst thing is that she took a metaphor with this “I’m like s chiwawa next to a Great Dane” like .. are u in the right mind to compare yourself to a dog. Tf It rly cringe and some parts that was like “yeah I fell in love with you since the first day but miscommunication exists and I thought u hated me. -_-“ like tf. And the worst part is “dw sweetheart. I quit my job for you so you can get the COO position but u don’t and this was all for nothing, well boo boo” It was cringe and not okay. The concept of the story on the other hand was quite. Had you given this to Colleen hoover or anyone else, it could have been an amazing but sally Thorne just ruined it by making it so cringe. I haven’t read any of her other books and I’m not playing on doing so. I do not recommend :)
I’ve read this book multiple times already (my mom gave it to us when my dad passed away) and I always come back to it. Sad, relatable, funny and strange.“Moving on, as a concept, is for stupid people, because any sensible person knows grief is a long-term project. I refuse to rush. The pain that is thrust upon us let no man slow or speed or fix.”
I had fun reading it because it is set in Corfu where I sent my last summer holiday. But it really does only talk about Gerry and the animals he finds on the island and brings back to his family's house. There is not really a plot, which can make it hard to get through. But it is at times very enjoyable to read: it is funny and interesting to learn about Corfu's wildlife.
Beautiful book and felt important to read. It is about the end of the communist era in Albania and it is based on the writer's own experiences when she was a teenager in Albania. Would highly recommend to anyone and especially those interested in history and the Balkan countries.
Very important book!!! Must read for everyone, and especially women who use contraception! It's frustrating how little we still know about the side effects of hormonal contraception and how the side effects that do seem to play up are subtle but can be life-changing! Must must read
Bit heavy on the filler. Also CFRs as a management concept is not nearly as worked out as OKRs and it shows, not sure why they were included. But if you're considering implementing OKRs this book has plenty of examples about how others have done it. And I do like the concept.
This review is not from the point of a theoretical physicist. I recommend this book to anyone with an active curiosity about fundamental physics. Maybe you are like me, and you have read a few pop science books that put our current understanding in layman terms. Often they then postulate the theories of the future, in deceivingly convincing arguments. Loop gravity or string theory sound so great, surely breakthroughs happen frequently? Not so.Lost in Math gives an unique insight in the work of theoretical physicists. Hossenfelder takes the reader through several interviews with physicists, intertwined with a history of recent theoretical physics and its failure to get experimental confirmation. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and I hope that the problems both with personal and systemic biases towards unfounded (and untestable) beauty will be solved.A personal thought: The problems with the scientific system as a whole strike me similar to that often described in incumbent major companies: they are stuck in their ways and, until a small start-up comes by to disrupt, their progress is incremental at best. Is the turnaround time in science longer or does science not allow for this type of disruption? Maybe we will see a small clan of outsiders get significant results, changing the course of theoretical physics as a whole. Maybe the high costs of experiments are sufficient barriers of entry to prevent this from happening. Additional take away: Progress in the foundations of science and our understanding of the universe is not guaranteed, despite what the optimistic intellectual zeitgeist might claim. It is only the result of critical thinking and a refusal of how things are now that can drive the future. This refusal is not as omnipresent in theoretical physics as one would hope.
The dialogue with Larry the aquaman is awkward and Mrs Caliban herself is so plain. I think I misread the tone, or it just didn't appeal to me that much.
I hoped this could be, in a way, The Bonfire of the Vanities of tech. Just like in Wolfe's classic caricature of a Wallstreet bond trader, there are plenty of absurdities in tech culture that deserve to be ridiculed. This book takes some half-hearted jabs (crazy investors, incubators predicting the end of the world, dairy-alternatives at the in-house barista, idiosyncratic founders, nods to virtue-signaling wokeness), but they all are too on the nose. The main story and one-dimensional personalities don't save it.I do want to give this book credit for one thing: the startup's innovation (an AI that creates custom pseudo-religious rituals for its users) suddenly seems not that unrealistic given current LLM innovations.
Ehh I don't mind the grossness, and the style is fine if not a bit ambiguous. However, I was expecting the "bleakness of humanity" to be exposed in all its awfulness, but it just felt a bit... cheap. Maybe I haven't warmed up to Moshfegh yet
Gives some perspective on how different cultures have different social expectations. Biggest take-away is that your specific cultural context is just one instance of a plethora of possibilities. This book gives good insights in the alternatives, and teaches you not to take yours for granted.Things I didn't like: •Overly wordy and repetitive examples •Some explanations for cultural definitions were mentioned, but they were not very convincing. If philosophers are pointed at as being the cause for a certain belief, there should be a justification as to why their work is not just a product of their culture. •Although it is mentioned a few times, every culture will still have variance within. The author says: "True, but my generalizations are still useful". Sure, but can we get a bit more consideration on dealing with this, and the extent to which this variance occurs within a culture? Of course, this criticism is a tad petty, and cultural differences are not to be distilled into an exact science.
Read this for Metamorphosis, which was fun and absurd. "In the Penal Colony" stood out among the other stories. Candidly described cruelty, the inner debate of the traveler as he decides his responsibility, and the officer justifying his actions. Makes for a memorable story.
Great through its simplicity.
I won't pretend to be an authority on Nietzsche or philosophy, hence no rating, but I would like to give some thoughts on The Joyful Wisdom (often translated as The Gay Science), with the risk of sounding as pretentious as I feel.I got gifted "Beyond Good and Evil" last year and got stuck about halfway through. With renewed optimism I started in The Joyful Wisdom, a very attractive title nowadays. I was told it would be relatively accessible and also introduces some well-known ideas (including "God is Dead"). The book counts about 400 aphorism of varying themes, so I won't attempt a structured review.* I wish I could read this in german, or at least would have picked up a Dutch translation. The line between philosophy and poetry is constantly blurry. * A lot of the sentiments in this book have aged well. The infamous declaration of atheism is followed by a lesser known nuance which now seems predominant (at least in my age group). "No! We have no longer the bitterness & passion of him who has broken loose, who has to make ... a martyrdom out of his unbelief". * So has Nietzsche's criticism of his time. This makes me wonder whether such criticism is really time-bound. He criticizes his peer's constant focus on productivity and work, something which now seems to be omnipresent. The consideration that someone could live a happier life without working as hard as they can is a discomforting thought. I quickly put that thought away before it can do too much harm. Let me do so again.* hehe "Politics might one day become so vulgar as to become 'The Prostitution of the Intellect'" * Obligatory mention about the fact that this is still a book written in the 19th century, with a fair share of sexism and racism. Surprising little amount of antisemitism, some disapproval of Wagner for it, preceding Nietzsche contra Wagner. (Alright so I read a bit more about this and it seems to be a common misunderstanding that Nietzsche was antisemitic)* In a time where everyone seems so eager to speak up to apparent immoral behaviour without often engaging in any real discussion, it is a breath of fresh air to read that the preaching certainty in one's moral conviction is often showing for the lack of thought they gave it. Really not that profound but I'm sure it was worded beautifully. Let me save the rest of my so very necessary interpretations to myself. I'd recommend this as a book to read a few pages at a time in when you feel like it. I read about every other day for two months because I have an irrational urge to finish books but you should just pick it up whenever you feel like it. "The irrationality of poetry refutes you, ye utilitarians!"
You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but I'm afraid I did. After reading Kahneman's experiments on well being and happiness in the latter half of Thinking, Fast and Slow, I was on the lookout for an analytical view on happiness. The combination of the title, equation on the cover art, connection with Google and the appealing 'engineer your path to joy' lead me believe this was what I was looking for. Sadly this book is not that. It's a highly subjective, very non-nuanced self-help book. And although I'm not the biggest fan of self help books, I can appreciate them from time to time. This book however, did not live up to these second expectations.The opening sets the tone for the book, informal instructions for happiness, intertwining the touching personal story. It sets up this very simple "Happiness Equation". The equation itself is backed up minimally, but is used and referenced to constantly throughout the book, often as an argument for other advice.The first part considers "6 Grand Illusions". I enjoyed this part, the text was not exactly profound, and I was annoyed by the tone and illustrations, but I felt it told a consistent story with a core of truth to it. Take for example the "Illusion of Knowledge", in which Gawdat explains how limited our understanding of the world really is. Humbling for sure. It piqued my interest for the last part, called "5 Ultimate Truths". (The second part, "7 Blind Spots", I am fairly neutral about.)If Knowledge is an illusion, I was hoping for some distilled, minimalist truths that would leave me with a bare, but sure view of life. The opposite was true. The last part, "5 Ultimate Truths" ultimately spoiled this book for me. First of all, the "Truths" here are everything except "Ultimate", and the lack of acknowledgement is in stark contrast with the illusion of Knowledge.Gawdat starts with 2 neutral chapters about the "Now" and "Change", uninspired but okay. He then delivers a mess of chapter about "Love" filled with empty, sometimes confusing paragraphs. A special mention to this awful metaphor: "In physics, the law of conservation of energy never goes away. It never even diminishes. It changes form, but in any closed system the amount of energy you start with will be the amount you end with. Love follows the same law [...] Actually it does one better than energy: it attracts the love of all beings in you. Like a savings account, the more love you deposit, the more it grows and multiplies so that when it's time for you to withdraw, even more will be there for you. Call that the law of conservation-or multiplication-of love." (formatting mine)Considering Gawdat is quick to mention he is an engineer, I wonder if he was even trying with this book. Or maybe he never understood the concept of conservation of energy.The last two chapters, both under the umbrella of "Ultimate Truths", try to convince the reader of both the existence of an afterlife and the existence of a designer, a godlike figure. Both are crucial for Gawdat's guide to happiness, so you would expect the "Ultimate" case to defend them. To put it bluntly, there is not. In the latter, the existence of the designer, is defended in what Gawdat calls a mathematical proof, slandering the entire field in one sweeping misunderstanding of a proof. Arguing that the absence of a designer implies that everything that happens is completely random, and since the chances of that happening are so small, it is more likely that there is a designer. Quite an embarrassing chapter. Examples showing a convenient misunderstanding of evolution theory. Generally this chapter was so messy I do not know where to begin tackling it without going on a tangent.Although I am very tempted to give you some of the countless ridiculous examples in the latter chapter, I will resist that temptation. Overall, I felt like this book did not attain what it set out to do. The structure was fine, but the last part did not effectively close out the book. Highlights were the convincing Illusions in the first part and the personal story. Low points were the claims with lack of or laughable reasoning. There was a lack of defense to serious objections. It is good practice to address serious objections, it is bad practice to find the weakest objection to counter, as done in the last chapter of the book. To conclude, this book does not claim bizarre things. I can find myself in a belief of an afterlife or a designer for example. It is the way they are framed and defended which bothers me. This book could cut a lot of fat, rethink some of its analysis, address more objections and become a 4 star book.
The term "hedge fund" evokes a strong reaction from most, whether you consider them the Masters of the Universe (a lá Bonfire of the Vanities) or the worst Symptoms of a greedy financial system. Whatever side you fall on, this book gives a great account of the history of the most fascinating financial firms. I'm not sure how to value Mallaby's reasoning that hedge funds (mostly) require no regulation, and it is definitely not one of the strong take-aways of this book. Instead it is a nice intro to the landscape and context that these firms operate in.
Look past the title (which as a statement an sich is reasonable, but as a title is mostly provoking), and you'll learn a lot. I like the (rightfully) unforgiving attitude and how Eddo-Lodge reflects on the development of her own perspective. Her honest assessment is as necessary as it is bleak.
As with many of the readers that picked up this book as soon as it was published, this review is from the perspective of a space enthusiast. For years, SpaceX has been very inspiring for me, and I was already broadly familiar with the events of the early days.Even still, I blasted through this book in three days, and it has cost me some sleep (in the good way). The story is told incredibly. Berger tells us about the personal sacrifices, the amazing accomplishments, the butt-clenching obstacles. A Elon Musk quote on one of the last pages stood out to me: It is a great story. But it is way better in recollection than at the time. There is probably some truth in saying that this book romanticizes a destructive work culture, and Berger does not shy away from highlighting the drawbacks. Still, I cannot help but being inspired, albeit jealous, at this struggle. A captivating book, recommendation for anyone who wants to better understand SpaceX's roots.
Captivating, and an absorbing style. Lost me a bit towards the end, and I feel like a lot of the symbolism went over my head. Read it in two sessions, and I think it would've been even better in one.
Liked it a lot, but the book is not perfect. As many students, I spent a lot of time with the details of mathematics, and this story was a great way to zoom out and enjoy the overview of, in this case, geometry. Combined with the historical context it beautifully showcases what makes mathematics unique: Ingenuity and creativity, but with a strong sense of inevitability. That being said, I feel like a big part of the subtleties of the explanations in the latter part (on physics) were hindered by the writing style. Don't get me wrong, the writing style is hilarious: it does a great job at making math accessible and not scary. But this accessibility comes at a cost, as Mlodinow does not mention a single equation in the whole book. I think it was Stephen Hawking's publisher who said: "For every equation you include in the book, the number of readers is halved". Still, Hawking chose to include some. Mlodinow does not, sadly. I can imagine that a reader who is not familiar with the equation of the uncertainty principle, would have a significantly harder time following this part in the book.Of course, as the book goes over the cutting edge 2o years ago (string theory with all its optimism), this is too complicated to be condensed into simple, intuitive explanations. If string theory and supersymmetry would have since become the revolution it promised, this would have been forgiven. But it did not, thus this was by far the weakest chapter of the book. (Side note: this is a fun chapter to read if you have also read "Lost In Math" by Sabine Hossenfelder. This chapter suffers from just about every problem she describes).I would recommend the first 3 parts (on Euclid, Descartes, Gauss) to anyone who has taken high school geometry for granted. It shows the progression of western mathematical thinking in a captivating way. The 4th part (on Einstein) is fascinating on its own. The 5th part (on Witten), you should really only read to throw around a few cool words at parties.
Idk of ik nog tel as bilingual als ik both engels en nederlands niet meer beheers;but that was part of the reason this book piqued my interest. Out of a meriad of conclusions about bilingualism, two stood out for me:* It is easier (i.e. there is less mental resistance) to mix a foreign language into our native tongue than the other way around. The hypothesis for why has to do with inhibition. When learning a foreign language, your brain actively inhibits you from expressing yourself in your first language. This control is never learned for your first language, so once you become fluent enough in the new language, words seep through. This rings very true to my personal experience: my Dutch is littered with English, but I rarely use Dutch words when speaking English. * We have a lesser emotional response to words in a foreign language compared to our first language. And since much of our cognitive biases are the consequence of subconscious emotional reactions, common biases such as loss aversion and the conjunction fallacy are less pronounced in a second language. Imagine all the second language immigrants, a competitive edge over their peers...Costa does a great job conveying his enthusiasm for the field, but I do feel as though this book came a bit too early to be the definitive book on the topic. Many of the effects of bilingualism seem to have just been brought to light, and a more top-down conclusion (á la system-1 vs system-2 in Kahneman) is still lacking. Maybe in a couple years, if the science converges onto a neat conclusion.EDIT: Since writing this review, I've learned that Albert Costa passed away in 2018, two years before the release of the English translation of this book. In light of this, the criticism in my last comment is a bit insensitive. I can wholeheartedly say this book is great testament to his lifetime of research, and I'm sure will inspire many to continue his work!
Written as a true thriller. Could do with more high-level explanations of many of the financial concepts, I spent a lot of time googling about junk-bonds, PIK securities etc etc. But on the flipside, that was a good test of my understanding for things I thought I knew, so I'm happy about it.
I enjoyed reading this book, Isaacson is a skilled and proven author, there are many fascinating stories and anecdotes.In many ways this does not feel like a Walter Isaacson Biography. It lacks the finality, the objective distance, the abstraction of the daily whims and twists. I understand and agree that Musk was impossible for Isaacson to ignore, given his bibliography so far. Or maybe he wanted to write a first account, after so many historical reports. But what is gained in anecdotes is lost in analysis. Surface level descriptions of events are more prominent than extensive descriptions about their context and consequences.It does, however, offer a view of Musk on a psychological level that is usually concealed behind the achievements, aspirations and controversy. Sure to nuance whatever opinion you had.
This book has two sides, which tend to alternate:1. Full-on nerd science fiction, a captivating possible rendition of the computer intelligence singularity. Complete with alternative quantum theories and a metaverse (sort-of) before it was cool. 2. Detailed descriptions of the most twisted, gruesome torture and sex. To the question "what would living forever in a post-scarcity world be like?", the answer here is dystopian. Everything, and especially pleasure, is boring. But pain is just a little less boring. So let's get skinned alive, or raped by a zombie, shall we? At times uncomfortable, but never dull.
Accessible and easy to read introduction to the applications of a wide array of mathematical models in neuroscience. I had a relatively easy time with the mathematical concepts as most of them I've seen before in some form, but Lindsay does a great job giving intuitive explanations anyway.Especially surprised to learn that the convolutional neural network (CNN), a dominant method in computer image recognition, was inspired in concept by the workings of our visual cortex. Whenever I heard people say that neural networks are modelled after how the brain works, I always assumed it was only the very high-level idea. The concept of the CNN was later modified and scaled up to be more useful for many computer applications. I learned from this book, these modified neural networks had started to represent the visual cortex even more. That is a fascinating discovery.A wide array of different mathematical tools are covered in this book. Personally I enjoyed the mentions of graph theory/network science and information theory.For those curious about how intuition about the brain's working can be translated into exact, quantifiable terms, this is a great book. There is much ambiguity around what goes on in our heads, and math definitely does not get rid of all of it (yet). But it is reassuring to see the progress that can be made this way.
A strong case of everything working out in the end. Full of romanticization of Italian life and very hopeful. But it glows. Florence glows. The romance glows. So I happily indulge.
Steve Jobs was a deeply fascinating man, in many ways different from the typical early Silicon Valley entrepreneur. His impact has been so profound that some of his idiosyncratic qualities have become defining for the tech culture (launching many copycats as well).Walter Isaacson is no stranger to expounding on the life and character of complicated historical figures the likes of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein. Having read these before, I was not disappointed by this biography. Since Steve Jobs was alive and cooperative for the writing on the book, it is much more personal than Isaacson's other biographies. The book is full of first hand reflections by Jobs on his earlier life choices and behaviour. This reflective tone allows the book to be honest about the jagged edges of Jobs' personality. I can wholeheartedly recommend this book.
Thrilling. Raskolnikov's thoughts are so restless and as a reader this is almost infectious, to the point I had trouble falling asleep after reading for a while. That being said, thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to rereading it.
Written with clarity, and a welcoming introduction (for men) to the, by now politicized, term "patriarchy", before it was so. Many struggles I hadn't considered to be on the plane of patriarchy, seem in hindsight very related. This was the main revelation for me; patriarchy is not just a system of hierarchy but has underpinnings in many social aspects.Petty criticism would include the strong reliance on the author's anecdotal relations with partners and family.Falters at pinning down a concrete alternative, i.e. what does the new masculinity of "becoming the whole self" really mean? This is explained mostly through stressing what masculinity should not be. It doesn't invalidate the main thesis but does leave you without direction as how to proceed.
Got the book for one chapter, the early study of citation networks. Was planning on reading the whole thing, but after the second chapter, "Galton Revised", I realized it's not for me. Presents a pretty one dimensional view on what makes a good scientist through statistical regularities on # of PhDs, science society membership and intelligence tests. Not my cup of tea.The chapter on citation networks is remarkable. It is packed with observations and poses many interesting questions and concepts that are active fields of research up to this date. 4/5 for this.So far for the wonders of the, oh so fascinating, world of Bibliometrics.
Great journey exploring the mysteries of time through phyics. Really enjoyed the almost philosophical exploration of the implications of the new Order of Time. Rovelli continues being one of my favorite physics authors.
Usually, my metric for rating science fiction is the quality and quantity of science fiction ideas. Show me believable futures and technology in way I hadn't imagined them before. Snow Crash promises and delivers well on this front. It shows a dystopian, corrupt world with a deranged gig economy, a precognizant rendition of the digital world (the Metaverse) and creative parallels between linguistics and computing. Many of these ideas have aged well since it was written, adding an extra dimension to the enjoyment. You have to wade through many fictional acronyms and brands, but it leads to a vivid world.Some small things bug me, like the long, meandering pseudo-historic tangents about ancient civilizations and their relation to languages. Conceptually semi-interesting, but it is not clear where the "real" history ends and the fictionalized facts begin. I'm just not an alternative-history kind of guy.But as the worldbuilding is finished, the Scifi concepts have been introduced and the plot has to unfold, you become painfully aware that the protagonists are emotionally void. That made reading the second half such a bore. The craziest shit will happen, and the characters will respond in the most nonchalant way, if at all. This makes all the vividly-described action scenes just plain boring. I have zero investment in the characters, because not for a second do I believe that something will go wrong. To add to that, why is Y.T only 15 yo? She is not naive or afraid, on the contrary, she navigates the world better than the other characters (all at least twice here age) and is cynical as hell. Her age just added an extra level of perversity to the sex scene that has no obvious point. The story ends with many loose ends. The fast-and-furious showdown after building up an extremely cerebral existential threat also feels like a cop-out.
"Revealing", although cliché, is the perfect adjective. Strips away the fluffy, idealistic, virtuous view on Silicon Valley, and leaves a greedy, cynical, bordering-on fatalist attitude. The Silicon Valley described here is just as morally deprived as any money-hungry industry. That Martínez has this view shouldn't be surprising, as he worked in advertising. Ten years later, we see advertising as synonymous with internet consumer companies (i.e. Facebook, Twitter). But in 2012, it was merely the necessary evil that the still youthful industry resorted to for paying the bills. The engineers that ended up there were not as idealistically zealous as those at the core of these companies. Exactly this makes the book fascinating, as it describes a key point in the Valley's maturation. In many ways, this 2016 report of a small corner of its culture, revealed where the culture as a whole was heading.Yes, Martínez blatantly objectifies women at various points in the books. But, Martínez's tone of an over-the-top self-elected asshole is refreshing! It allows for an honest documentation of the juggling of his investors, his startup's response to the lawsuit, and the negotiation of his acqui-hire. Even his absenteeism as a father of two children is stated with only the smallest attempt of moral justification. Sure, there must be plenty of exaggerations and misrepresentations of the real events, but you know, I didn't mind it.
Really enjoyed the first half but lost me in the second.
Thoroughly enjoyed it. I like the rigor with which Dawkins sets up the playing field, making clear what the gene is, what defines altruistic and selfish behaviour. Additionally the depth with which evolutionary stable strategies are explored is a breath of fresh (although 40 year old) air in the pop science category. Especially surprising was the general message about human altruistic behavior of the book, or rather, the lack thereof. I have come across countless mentions of The Selfish Gene, most claiming it to be part of the 'homo economicus' zeitgeist. As Dawkins regrets in his additional preface, much of this must come from the unfortunate choice of title (and the fact that most writers and journalists do insufficient research). The Selfish Gene makes almost no mention nor judgment about the inherent morals of humanity. It mostly stays away from examples concerning humans, with some exceptions. Morality is clearly not within the scope of this book, and never was.I am a fan of Dawkins witty, casual but sharp style of writing, but, as he agrees with me in the prefaces, sometimes it undermines the message about the impartiality of the gene. Much of my annoyances where cleared up or admitted to in this anniversary version.I'm off to explore the more recent books on the genome, as The Selfish Gene managed to uncover a curiosity for evolutionary biology in me I did not know I had!
Me and all my homies are Bayesian rationalists
I've never read a billionaire's own account of their life, but it checks the boxes you'd expect. Shum is self-congratulating, has an unconvincing narrative of persistence, is arrogant and righteous. To his credit, he does acknowledge the role of luck, and how his wife shaped him, in his successes. But this book is not interesting because it's written by a member of the super-rich: it's interesting because it's about China from a perspective that helped shape it.Shum represents the class of go-getter entrepreneurs that pushed and pulled China into the 21st century.It reveals how business worked in the contradictory environment of state-controlled capitalism. The modus operandi, of gaining guanxi (network) with gaogan (high cadre Party members). It contains a lesson about not flying too close to the sun.So, if you can look past the author's self-embellishment, and always keep in mind it is a one-sided account, it is a revealing read.
The last Isaacson biography on my list, and the longest one at that. I went into this book with little knowledge about Kissinger or his work. He's one of those household names that your parents will definitely know lots about, but you might not (if you're my age). This meticulous account of his foreign affairs serves as a history lesson from a unique perspective. The Machiavellian nature of Nixon's administration is ever fascinating.Isaacson is unparalleled in giving the complete character description of complicated men, including all their contradictions. Kissinger is certainly a man full of contradictions. These contradictions appear not only in his arrogance and insecurity. They show in his realpolitik practices, often accused of being inhumane, that stem from a deep pessimism caused by his upbringing as a jew in Nazi germany. This book is probably the best account for understanding the nuance to his villainized policies in various conflicts, including the bombing of Cambodia.
Phenomenal but frightening.This was not a fun book to read. Not because it was written poorly (I got quite caught up in it), but because the facts presented are unsettling. Merchants of Doubt demonstrates studiously how a few organized opinion makers (often ex-scientists) can discredit an elaborate scientific consensus on societal problems, thus swaying public opinion and stunning governmental action and policy. A must-read for everyone who cares about science and politics, and wishes to gain insight in how these two are kept apart.
2.5/5First couple of stories were what I expected with Murakami, although more open-ended both in story and interpretation, something that I liked. Later stories felt a bit like filler. I suppose if you read a lot of Murakami the autobiographical murmuring has some redeeming qualities, but it was bland to me. His reflections and memories are enjoyable, the same way listening to your grandpa over coffee is. His passion for jazz, classical music and baseball were not particularly infectious, although I did listen to Schumann's Carnaval.Maybe I'd recommend this to someone who has read all of Murakami's other books, but admittedly, I haven't, so I can't be too sure. To anybody else, probably better off reading some of his other work.
“Raise High..” - Highly enjoyable. Just a banger of dialogue and personality. Would it be an insult to say this is like situational comedy that you can be snobby about? Because I don't say that as an insult.“Seymour” is crucial for the Salinger-universe, but as a story, not so much. It's just... too long. I find it kind of telling that this is the last story that was published in book form while he was alive. It all comes across as very uncritical. Maybe that is the point: a "semi-diary about a dead brother", as Buddy (i.e. Salinger ) puts it. Still I'm sad that the story ended: connecting the dots of the Glass family across stories, with Buddy appearing as the fictional author of some of Salinger's other stories. And then, boom, even a Caulfield shows up. Is this what the Marvel fans feel when they get a crossover cameo? Generally, there is a certain trick throughout Salinger's short stories. He sketches these eclectic geniuses, admired by all since childhood, who let you, the reader, into their amicable irony. Then, as you feel privileged to be in their company, chuckling about those who aren't, some subtle profound observation by Seymour, or Zooey, or Franny, or whoever, is slipped in, usually not even in a dedicated paragraph, but as an indirect recollection by their sibling, in some idiosyncratic medium, be it scraps of literary feedback, lipstick on the bathroom mirror or a quip during a game of marbles. Already, before you vocalize the words in your head, you are in awe of the astuteness of thought. No sight of the skepticism you'd have if the words had appeared on their own. Not that these observations are of no value, the contrary. But seriously: here I am, reading meticulous descriptions about a fictional author's fictional brother's nose, as if it is a crucial bit of information to understand their prolific poems, poems that, may I remind you, do not actually exist. Maybe Salinger champions in immersion, above all.
Rightfully a forgotten classic. Superficially interesting as a late 19th century optimistic prediction of the future, but it is so dry, despite the poor attempt of mixing in a romance.
5 short essays on totalitarianism. It's hard to judge the content when the very topic has since evolved so much. There is hope in the fact that the pessimistic outlook Orwell had in the early forties did not realize as he thought. Especially since the described trends seem present today. It offers an interesting perspective but it seems as if the core ideas have become more accepted and household than at the time of publishing.
This book reached me in a coincidental way, so I read it with no expectations. I am not familiar with Nâzim Hikmet nor with Orhan Kemal, or Turkish literature in general. But I was pleasantly surprised! One of my favorite books I've read this year. I very much enjoyed how Nâzım's character is portrayed, his dedication to his craft in combination with a childlike attitude towards often overlooked parts of life. The friendship between these (aspiring) writers, stuck in the mundanity of a prison, is unique. I appreciate how despite their depressing situation, they found meaning in their work, and had hope for its own sake. Taking things at face value and finding optimism in spite of it, is an outlook that came at the right time in my life.In a way, being unfamiliar with both artists' work, I am getting a very incomplete image of much of the context. But it is a testament to Orhan Kemal's writing that his friendship with Nâzım described in this book came alive in such a touching way.My favorite quote from the book: If we could just have a few pleasurable moments in this transitory world.
I, at first, did not intend on reading "Becoming". I expected a puffed up publicity book (influenced by the media about the Obamas' big advances, Michelle's use of a ghostwriter). High reviews because people are just hungry for decency in the current political climate. But I decided to give it a shot after having to endure a never ending stream of quotes from my parents.In some aspects, my prejudice was confirmed, the stylized writing style was what you would expect of a book crafted for mass appeal. But, this did not hold back Michelle's message, it made it go down even smoother.Politics were discussed minimally (so was criticism on the current administration), rather there was a focus on everything surrounding politician #1. From "Becoming", I learned the following notable things:* Michelle is of admirable practical intellect, shown in sensible judgments. She understands the impact her parents had on her life. Not only with their support in saving for college, but especially with the smaller things, such as asserting Michelle was moved to a gifted classroom, small advantages that snowball to something major.* Michelle is unapologetically human. She cares deeply for her kids. What I often take away from biographies of other larger-than-life figures (Franklin, Einstein) is that they universally share the problem of combining ambition with family. Considering the Obamas' situation, they managed well (better than Barracks aforementioned counterparts). * Running for president might be the most life absorbing thing someone can commit themselves and their surrounding to. I'm intrigued and intimidated.* Michelle's experience with being the only woman, only African-American in so many important places are articulated. She, for example, goes into the lack of diversity at her Ivy league education. The impact of this issue is explored, but in a predictable way. I'm not taking away a profound perspective or insight on being the minority, neither did I learn tips on how to climb the ladder when you are seemingly always at a lower step. Overall, I blasted through this story in a few days. It is easy to read, well written and filled with quotables. Towards the middle of the last part of the book, the story's novelty wears off due to the surprising homogeneity of presidential family life. It is at a constant insane 100% all the time. (Security everywhere, so many important events, so weird for the kids, so much media attention, so many tragedies.) At the end, the novelty comes back again, as the disheartening election and the following departure out of the White House unfolds.
Amazing! From a comprehensive overview of natural science's history up to the cutting edge of fundamental physics. I am no physicist, and I don't think this book gave me a clear understanding of the world we live in (what book could possibly?). But let it be clear that this is no criticism. On the contrary, I think Rovelli achieved what he set out to do. He convinced me of the strangeness of the world we interact with. I think the last chapter summarizes this very neatly:"A scientist is someone who lives immersed in the awareness of our deep ignorance, in direct contact with our own innumerable limits, with the limits of our understanding."Now I don't consider myself a scientist quite yet, but I think this book did put me in direct contact with our innumerable limits. It certainly made me aware of my deep ignorance. This book is one of the few pop science books written by a distinguished physicist that dares to talk about theories and problems that still lack consensus in the scientific community. It shows us a glimpse, fully aware of the uncertainty of the matters, of today's mysteries and tomorrow's breakthroughs. Rovelli brings his expertise, presents it so accessibly but simultaneously dripping in childlike passion and excitement. You'll finish this book dazed and confused, richer with countless new concepts and theories you are only just barely beginning to grasp, but you'll be immersed, impressed and excited. Hungry for knowing how the world works.
Specifically enjoyed the general (not just USA) chapters. The parts on just the USA are less timeless in writing, although not less relevant to the current state of things.
Good exposé about Von Neumann's work, but as his work was so remarkably broad, it never got deeper than a short introduction. I'm a fan of science history and biographies, but this was not the most successful combination. Bhattacharya also feels the desperate need to explain why every bit of his work was significant or visionary, sometimes reaching for farfetched examples. Still thoroughly enjoyed it, Von Neumann's legacy is very impressive. His name is too unknown for what his accomplishments amount to.
The tone is comical. The author probably does the best job possible writing a story encapsulating the liquid propellant development up to the 70s. Thing is, the best job is still very repetitive. The book shines in its quirky and particular anecdotes, but a big part is outlining the consequential chemical combinations that were tried. Listing of chemicals gets dull.I'm still happy I read the whole book, as it contextualizes many rocket fuel fundamentals & trade-offs, which makes them in turn easier to remember. And it explains the roots of rocketry today. In the closing of the book, the author states that "There appears to be little left to do in liquid propellant chemistry ...". Pages before, he says "big first-stage space boosters will continue to use liquid oxygen and RP-1... ". 50 years later, this exact rocket propellant is used in SpaceX's Falcon 9 (one of the most flown boosters this decade). So, John Drury Clark seems to have known his field!
Much to be said about this novel, one of my favorites in a while. I'll restrict myself to one observation: you know how, when some awful tragedy befalls someone, you wonder how life could ever continue for them? Well, in this book, Baba's life never continues, and the book slowly reveals the tragedy that's at the cause of it all. But aside from this theme, there is much more going on. Solitude and homesickness are centre, many apt observations about the intangible feeling of belonging. Its good alright
Brings clarity and a well-balanced perspective to a topic so often clouded by ideology. I have some questions about chapter 10, on personal responsibility. It introduces the "e2" metric of differences in life outcome not explained by genetics or social environment. This metric is calculated in identical twin studies, and it turns out to be quite small: there is little room for "personal action". But it raises the question: Do identical twins growing up in the same social environment not influence eachother, leading to inevitably more similar outcomes?
Thiel is a very underreported figure, esp internationally. I'd not recommend this as the complete work on Thiel's character (it misses that mark), but rather as evidence of the divergent political affiliations of tech power brokers. Thiel is one of, if not the, most prominent. Mistakenly, the left-leaning employees are assumed to represent those who make strategy / control funding. This should convince you that is not true.
This is an academic essay that is clear both in formulating the questions it asks and answering them. It is written well.An incomplete summary:Industrial policy is defined NOT as general infrastructure, investment in human capital or investment by local governments (China has 10's of thousands). Instead as direct subsidies (through funding, tax breaks, etc) for the development of an industry. Is China's unprecedented economic growth over the last 40 years a consequence of industrial policy? No. Real industrial policy in China is new (starting in 2006, ramping up as stimulus following global financial crisis). First through "megaprojects" (2006-7), now (since 2015) through IDDS (innovation driven development strategies). The big, new instrument is the Industry Guidance Fund (IGF). A whopping $1.5T of funding has been allocated to these funds. The IGF can been viewed as the Chinese state answer to American capital markets. IGFs are funds consisting of state funds, SOE (state owned enterprise) investments and private capital. They invest like Venture Capital funds, private equity funds and take stakes in public companies.IGFs have the vision to develop General Purpose Technology, and "leap-frog" the cutting edge. They hope to create spillover effects across industries by investing heavily into one.The IGF that is furthest in its lifespan is the Integrated Circuit (IC) fund, focused on semiconductor manufacturing. Its funds are used for building new fabs (50%) by investing in companies, consolidating companies through M&A (20-30%), and improving the vertical supply chain (packaging etc). The IGF is a truly novel instrument, and there are valid concerns surrounding the performance incentives and opportunities for (soft) corruption.China is in its core a middle income country. This massive industrial policy is a gamble. The costs are immense. Time will tell whether this will pay off.
Cannot judge the accuracy, but I liked the foreshadowing of historic events for later justification. If anything, a bit too heavy on conflicts that changed leadership, and the particularities of certain rulers. Could have done with more descriptions about the typical life in these ancient societies instead. But it’s a short history, there is always more to tell. At least important cultural and scientific hallmarks were highlighted!
The unexpected you’d expect asking Norm Macdonald for a memoir
Everything I look for in a self-improvement book. Confronting, Internet came in my life when I was 12 and has played a big role since. It is intertwined with how I perceive entertainment, leisure and communicating with friends. It has been having a negative effect on my productivity for a long time. Repeated periods of procrastination have left a sour taste in my mouth when I think about platforms I have spent so much time on, such as YouTube and Reddit. This book, although aimed at the different demographic of office workers, has given me insights on how to tackle some of these habits, which I hope to put in to good use. It made me uncomfortable at times, reevaluating and feeling bad about how I spent my time. Ultimately I hope this new perspective, much of which has been brewing in my mind for a while, will help me live a more fulfilling life.I am willing to forgive the lack of scientific rigor on some of the arguments in favor of self-improvement case being made. I will admit my bias because I recognize many of my personal problems in this book.
Historic retelling was sometimes exciting, sometimes dull. The high level evaluations of the industry were balanced and transparent. Mallaby really likes Sequoia. I took some rough notes.1961-1968- Davis & Rock, first limited partnership.1976 - sequoia, with Valentine, buys into Atari. First example of stage-based investing. Both activist investors, so they got involved with company.Late 70s/early 80s - VC becomes a real network in the valley, weak ties. Quick investments, less due dilligence. Why SV? - no NCE, stanford open to collabs, but mostly the activism of investors. VCs also navigated which protocols became standard for PC.Then in 80s, we get Accel: expert investors. Can identify follow up deals. Anticipate industry direction. "Prepared mind".Cisco was invested in the original founders were ousted for other execs.In early 80s UUNET spent some time bouncing around but finally got investment by Accel. Conclusion: individual VCs fucked up but system as a whole worked.1995, Moritz part of Sequoia, helps Yahoo mature. Understands advertising business model. Son from SoftBank invests unprecedented 100m.Pre-ipo investments become bigger called growth venture investmens.Moritz represents new guard that is a baby boomer instead of depression, more optimistic, holds on longer before cashing in.Smaller VC firms see their early stake diminish as companies take huge sums from growth investments.1999: vc boom. But as VCs work together it is spoiling the party to call out the boom. So nobody calls the bubble.Google raises from angels, and gives minority share to VC. Then at IPO, two-class shares, in which second class (stock market investors) have 1 vote, vs 10 of founders. Founders maintain control. Start of founder cult phenomena.Startups move to only software, requiring less capital, reducing power of VCs, who are slow, cautious and overcapitalized. Avg vc share decreases.Late 90s. VC in China, via Sachs for Alibaba. Son buys 20m on a whim, returns 58B 15 years later, biggest VC win. Because of china law all companies had to be incorporated in Cayman islands. 2005 Capital Today launches in china and invests aggressively into JD.com, with employee equity plan similar to Intel's.Y Combinator w/ Paul Graham, anti-vc sentiment, founder cult. Founders Fund (Thiel) similar sentiment.Accel gets investment at FB, although parker is antivc. Couple years later the oust him.Perkins-Kleiner loses their ground, which is striking because reputation gives an edge in VC (so-called path dependenc). But bad cleantech strategy fucks it up.Milner invests 100m in FB, such that they can afford to delay their IPO. Huge payoff for founders, plus more control.Early 2000s, schleiffer, with blackstone experience, analyzes incremental margins of companies. Joins Tiger Global, invest into digital economy in china. No one else does.2009, a16z. Founder centric, but aims at coaching them. Also hired lots of support staff for sysadmin, recruitment. mostly Horowitz and andreessen savy at picking investments tho.and timingSequoia becomes top firm again early 2000s and stays there. Very disciplined. Very team focused, nurturing new talent. Goetz brings prepared mind from Accel, they catch mobile internet wave and "World of the developer" wave.Apply behavior psychology insights to prevent premature profit taking out of risk aversion.Scout investing: angel investing by current founders who's wealth is still in paper, but are most in touch with current tech.Sequoia early-bird system. Checked app download rankings in all countries to get leads on companies before they took off in the us.Growth investing takes off. Unicorns overvalued. Three problems- Lots of new players (PE, Hedgefunds) join, they want huge investments to move their portfolio needle.- They want stock with liquidation preference, st they pay a premium so companies get overvalued.- founder hubris.Gurley from Benchmark want to oust Kavanick.- threaten with publicly challenging, or resign in dignation. Kalanick does the latter.- convince Masayoshi Son (vision fund) to invest in uber some more on new (founder unfriendly) terms.- sue kalanick over google trade secret lawsuit, to get more board seats.Once second strategy succeeded, lawsuit was dropped Generally, a lot of growth investing came from non-trad players (mutual fund, hedge funds, saudis). IPO forced some discipline. Uber worked, wework flopped.Some arguments against vc- "lucky" Societally - blitzscaling can be bad, irresponsible, or undermine incumbents and societal value- its a clique: white and elite collegesIn favor- vc funded companies create value basically- especially suited to intangible assets.VC Internationally- israel succes story: used govt fund to fill on limited partner funds. Highest vc to gdp ratio worldwide.- EU failure: subsidies went to funds that were not LP, so less motivated and less skilled, and they drowned out the professionals. Result: up until 2007, avg annual return was -4%. (I looked it up and it's been 13% since, so not that bad).Four steps for govt to improve.Encourage LPs, Encourage stock options, invest in science ed, think globally.
Not really a review.This is the first book I read where digital conversations moved the plot. Text exchanges are written out explicitly and it feels natural. Admittedly I don't read a lot of fiction, but I did like it. I feel like we as society have reached a point of digital fluency that makes it possible to write about text conversation without it seeming gimmicky. (Is this the first step to the "metaverse" mr. Zuckerberg tells us about?)And it does make the book hit home a lot more. The inner turmoil that can be stirred up by a text from the wrong or right person; typing a draft, removing it, typing it again; the omnipresence of a channel of communication with a loved one and the pressure and expectation that comes with it; These are very real experiences of the modern human and I'm happy to see they translate well to books too. Of course, the email exchange between Alice and Eileen is archaic in comparison to text conversations. The emails do serve as a relief from the self pity and insecurities of their authors. Instead they are reflective in tone and brutally honest, but they do help bringing the characters alive. If you really want to know what someone thinks about themselves, let them monologue.
Not bad but just doesn't stand out. Mostly, it has aged quickly. The central thesis is that in the status quo, people in their twenties think they do not have to define their life yet, but that this is mistaken. It is an answer to a culture that, if it ever existed, has mostly seeped away. People in their twenties don't think "thirty is the new twenty" anymore, as far as I can tell. Nor is underemployment a big thing. If anything, the opposite seems to be true. You are expected to have a job with high status immediately. Due to this, the chapters on career just seem irrelevant. Chapters on body, brain and love are a bit more current, as our focus on a no-commitment twenties still dominates the alternative. Although the advice stays very surface level. I guess the biggest virtue of reading this is that it forces you to do some self-reflection. Jay also has a very go-getter attitude, which is inspiring but borders on downplaying harder issues.Below is a very brief summary of the main points I wrote down while reading. If these seem novel or contradictory to your worldview, it might be worth to read this book! Work • Don't be underemployed, but do jobs that get you identity capital, even if they pay less.• Weak ties -> nurture and use connection outside your immediate social circle, these are most useful.• although you might feel like your life's options are unbounded, secretly we know what we want / what we're good at. We've forgotten along the way.• There is social pressure to show off now (travelling etc.), while often the "settling" choices give us way better options later in life. • Even if you do something safe (e.g. work in an office), you can find ways to differentiate and customize your life. Love • Marriage -> statistics say later is better, up to 25. After that no benefit to success rate• Moving in with partner is often a convenient choice, but leads to lock-in, as there is no clear commitment decision. Statistically, marriage afterwards is more likely to fail. Effect disappears when couple is engaged before moving in.• For a partner, shallow similarities (age, education, social status) are important, but personality is also better to be similar than different. Neuroticism is a high predictor of failed relationship/marriage. You have to "be in like". Brain • Claim that frontal lobe develops in twenties, to deal with uncertainty of adult life. This part has questionable evolutionary reasoning and possible confusion of cause / correlation• Claim that in your twenties, underdeveloped amygdalae reacts too strongly to negative feedback. Needs to grow roots. Later in life, positivity effect kicks in.• Many people have a lack-of-growth mindset, you might assume you dont have "it" (talent, IQ, work ethic). But confidence in abilities comes from making hours, some anxiety is natural so just embrace it. Kids • Getting pregnant after 35 is very hard. Raising kids in your fifties is not ideal. Are having your twenties without kids worth it? Meg Jay doesn't think so but I'm on the fence. • make a timeline to see if everything you plan to do lines up, and then see how many years of fucking around in your twenties you can afford. Otherwise you risk missing the boat on the whole kids thing.
On the one hand, joining a foreign militia seems like a pretty memorable experience, and, according to Orwell, enriching too. On the other hand, I don't feel much for being hungry, cold, shot or dead.
It's hard for me to objectively rate this book, since I read it over the exams. So take my opinion with a grain of salt.I enjoyed the book, but it got tedious at times. It strayed away from it's constant change of protagonists in the first book, but instead stuck to a few important characters, which had it perks but also changed the pace of the story.Ending was very gripping and drew me into the story, deeper than anywhere before. That being said, it did have that 'I am the villain and let me just explain my evil plan for no apparent reason' part that could've been in a b movie. Don't take this crappy review I'm writing at 1:40am to deal with post-exam insomnia too seriously, it doesn't deserve the energy.
Walter Isaacson remains one of my favorite authors. He masterfully tells the stories of milestones in science, technology and innovation. Before getting into The Code Breaker, I have to give a bit of context on why I enjoy his books so much.The first book of him that I read was Benjamin Franklin - An American Life. I picked it up on a whim, having no particular affiliation with American history. I was swooped up in a mesmerizing account of a fascinating political and scientific life. How happy I was to discover that Isaacson had also written on topics that were right up my alley: Innovators, Einstein and Steve Jobs are inspiring and important books that give historical context to much of what I study and work on. I think another reason that Isaacson's books appeal to me, is that they give a familiar handhold when diving into topics that I am unfamiliar with. I would not have read much about Renaissance art history or details of sfumato, if it was not for the cohesive biography on Leonardo Da Vinci. Not that I would dismiss this topics as uninteresting, on the contrary, but the barrier of entry to actually coming in contact with them is significantly lowered. Isaacson's focus on both humanities, sciences and their interplay breeds curiosity.And what to breed curiosity more than genetic engineering, and the ethics that come with it? I remember genetics and evolution being a fascination of mine as a child, but that interest had mostly gotten out of sight in high school. I even dropped biology as a subject in favor of more mathematics. Sure, I read The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins a few years ago, and got a flavor of creative evolutionary reasoning, but I have not been very receptive to the developments on genetic engineering and CRISPR.The Code Breaker has given me more perspective on exactly that: what has changed in the last 15 years that has made genetic engineering so different? CRISPR has happened. By elaborating on the lives and the work of the key researchers, the significance of this scientific milestone is highlighted and its key components are made understandable. How competition, at times friendly, at time hostile, between research groups drove progress, how patent wars slowed application. Talking about applications: what can CRISPR and its various consequences be used for? When is genetic engineering a no-brainer and when do ethical complications show up? These questions are answered thoroughly (although the ethical considerations left me, as is expected, with more questions than answers). A section central to the book, the Chinese CRISPR babies in 2018, paints a picture of a hubric Chinese scientist who goes against international (albeit vague) guidelines to make the first inheritable genetic changes in human babies. Although the situation is nuanced, this section left me with the conclusion that He Jiankui, the scientist in question, deserves at least some recognition for (unintentionally) forcing the international field to establish clearer agreements. Jiankui has been persecuted and convicted for an inevitable development, which he did in a relatively harmless fashion. The punishment might be appropriate as to not encourage reckless gene editing, but I can't help but feel slightly bad for the guy.The historian in Isaacson wants to retell all events and personal relations in precise detail. That leads to a very complete retelling, but he risks getting repetitive at times. Especially the patent conflicts went on for a few pages too much. Similarly, the ethical discussion, which was a pleasure to read in its dedicated chapters, kept returning in many of the other chapters, with diminishing returns. This is a bit tiresome when you read the book linearly like I did, but it does mean that chapters can be read pretty much independently. Overall, The Code Breaker was enjoyable and informative. It tells the personal, the scientific and the ethical perspective. A strong recommendation.
Turns your world upside down. Reread chapters that initially confuse you, and this will be a 5/5 read.
Inspiring, although not flawless. Filled with truths but could use more elaboration in certain aspects. That being said, within its scope, the content in this book is solid.Bregman is an unique voice, and not a quiet one. It is not often that an opinion-maker with such bold statements has the balls to end his book pondering if his views are biased. Or whether they are productive (his answers on these questions are as you would predict). It demonstrates his nature of being a free thinker.A genuine recommendation for anyone who strives to do right, be optimistic and stay realistic.
I'd recommend reading Paul Graham's blog, reading whatever essays seem interesting to you, and leaving this book for what it is. Nothing in this book I strongly disagree with or think is poorly argued, but as a whole, the book has little direction.
Western Germany disunited+Unified block of East Elbia=East Elbia has disproportionate weight in German affairs.That is "The Shortest History of Germany" Hawes means, and what he'll try to convince you of. I am not the qualified person to judge if that is accurate, but it is certainly not a history book with the goal of an objective distance.
I read a book called "Happiness for Engineers" about 3 years ago. That book was a major disappointment. It turned out to be a poorly written, subjective account of how the author achieved happiness. I was looking for a more systematic approach to what a happy life would entail. And this is exactly what Finding Flow provided.This book was full of moments of recognition for me. For example, empty free time always has an averse effect on my mood, and this book explains why convincingly. Overall, it presents a complete picture of how our daily life's activities influence our experiences. There are no shortcuts to a good life, but this book grants some perspective. The only thing that left me confused was the last chapter, when the systematic approach is ditched for a second. The author assumed that we require some sort of overarching myth to replace religion in our life. An interesting science philosophy is brought forwards as an example, but it is hardly attempted to be convincing and it just left me confused with the point that Csikszentmihalyi was trying to make. I look forward to reading Flow (this book's precursor).
You might be mistaken to think this is a self help book; it is a motivational book that operates under the veil of a selfhelp book. Basically, you read through whatever insanity Goggins did, while he takes every opportunity to convince you of his extraordinarity, and then for two pages each chapter there are some haphazard tips about how you can be like him too. It is certainly inspiring, but also kinda hilarious.
Anyone who has an active interest in what the future holds, which is just about everyone, makes predictions, extrapolates trends and postulates about the world ahead. Often history is named as the prime resource, but maybe the predictions of history are just as valuable. Profiles of the Future was written in 1961 by prominent science fiction author Arthur Clarke. This time came after a tumultuous few decades for science and technology (not to forget the world wars): Einstein's special relativity, nuclear bombs, the conquering of the air with airplanes (many thought flying to be impossible in the early 20th century) and the space race just starting to kick up dust. It is fascinating to read Clarke's predictions. Some are eerily accurate, his thoughts on electric and autonomous cars have either been realized or are considered as near future (motor in the wheels, route-planning based on which roads are least busy, fleet driving with interconnected autonomous cars). He postulates the impact of global satellite radio, which if we take the liberty to apply to internet, has been one of the major developments of the last few decades: the accessible information would lead to: "Orbital newspapers ... Thus when you want your daily paper, you will switch to the appropriate channel, press the right button and collect the latest edition as it comes in. "Replace "channel" to "app" and that sounds a lot like on demand media to me. I can sum up a very long list of impressive predictions, but I should also include some misses. The biggest might be the chapter dedicated to G.E.M's (Ground Effect Machines, also known as Hovercraft). The vehicle to remove the distinction between sea and land, render roads redundant, make everything cheaper, safer, faster, has largely been a let down. Ah well, maybe the future holds some hovercraft adventures for us. Additionally, Clarke points out multiple times the looming overpopulation we will have to expect. Although less mouths on this earth would certainly help with feeding them sustainably, the demographic transition in developed countries seems to have addressed overpopulation as our existential threat in quite an elegant way.Overall, if you can get your hands on this book I would recommend you browse through it. It helps putting today's prediction into perspective and above all, it is a very entertaining read.
Fascinating, even 100 years after it was originally published. (1919) I'd divide this short read in three parts:1. Tesla's self-reflection, consisting of his development from an unusual child to an accomplished inventor. He is not humble, but that is not the point. He knows that he is 'a genius' and tries to find explanations why, and does so convincingly. 2. His career as an inventor. Sometimes difficult to see what statements are still valid today, and which have been nuanced or disproven. Don't expect a comprehensible guide through his discoveries, rather a summation of how he came to them and what their purposes are. Big part is about his never completed world system, which Tesla had immense expectations of. 3. The last few pages shine some light on his life philosophy. His deterministic world view and how to act with this knowledge. The nature of war and how it will be changed by technology, for better and for worse. Some eerily accurate predictions, even if they were eventually accomplished with different means than Tesla thought. It should be noted that this division into three parts is not that clear-cut, but it is the core subject-matter of this short but information-dense read.
Few good ideas drowned out by irrelevant and incomprehensible meandering. Frustrating
Every Colombian city we visited had a Parque de Bolívar and/or Plaza de Bolívar. We passed through the Simón Bolívar Airport. More legend than man, his bronze likeness looked magnanimously down on us, seemingly at every corner. It was this first impression that led me to this book. What life lead to this glory, to be remembered as the Libertador of a continent?My conclusion is that the story of Bolívar's life is ultimately tragic—Through a lifelong Herculean effort, Bolívar eradicated the Spanish from Latin-America. To do this, he employed at times cruelty and at times benignity, and temporarily overcame the debilitating societal chasms that the Spanish colonial rule festered off. But, for all his ambitions, those same chasms tore apart any hopes for the liberty and progressivism Bolívar envisioned. The very republics whose constitutions he wrote, sank into chaos, and so did his reputation, on the basis of mostly unfounded accusations. As he languishes from tuberculosis, the hero story ends with the bitter reality of a deeply dysfunctional continent. After his death, Bolívar becomes a symbol, employed by anyone for whatever motive. The Bolívar that oversees the plazas, or inspired the socialist Bolívarianism, is not the Bolívar that travelled 75,000 miles and fought in a war that was simultaneously a civil war and a struggle for independence. This biography portrays incredible feats of military brilliance, persistence, but also incomprehensible cruelty. At some point, you read with disbelief that Bolívar is raising yet another army, for yet another grueling 200 mile march, to rid the continent of yet another despot. Patriots and royalists alike are betrayed, beheaded or dismembered at every turn. If lucky, led to the firing squad. But, from the comforts of this century, it is a captivating read!
30% is elaboration on the structure and tasks of corporate boards. This part is fine, although nothing extraordinary.The other 70% can be summed up by "The future is different from the present, boards will have to adapt" but then on several specific trends. I was disappointed because the author almost never gave a clear example of a strategy forward, instead not venturing past the mere observation that a strategy is required.Also a lack of elaborate personal experiences, which could have made this book stand out, given the author's career.
Remarkable stories. Although most of this China likely does not exist anymore (a lot can change in 15 years), it was full of surprises.The migrant girls that Chang follows show a work ethic and drive to improve that shames contemporary "hustle culture". The environment in Dongguan, the factory city central in this book, upends typical gender norms: young migrant women are the most socially mobile class.Chang's family history is woven throughout, and as she explores the dynamics in rural China she offers careful suggestions to how the Cultural Revolution could have taken place. Very happy to have picked this up!
Obligatory warning: my opinion might not reflect yours, as I am most certainly biased. Not only am I a big fan of Walter Isaacson's biographies, having read his work on Benjamin Franklin and Einstein and thoroughly enjoying them both, I am also very passionate about the topics in this book.In "The Innovators", I especially enjoy Isaacson's analysis of personality, littered throughout the book. What role did the characters in the stories play in the technologies and their success? This book offers various insights: how, for example, friendliness requires a counterbalance of ruthless decision-making, within an individual or within a team. Or how visionaries and pragmatists need each other. Being an aspiring innovator (that sounds truly pretentious, doesn't it), I was engaged by this book's central question of how to spark innovation. Answers include: Let experimentalist meet theorists, have government funded research teams, have corporate funded research teams, let innovation be hacked together in an open source manner, let every inventor patent their discoveries and most importantly, all of the above. The biggest takeaway is that innovation appears in a variety of places, and variety is key when it comes to nourishing it.An interesting section close to the end was the consideration of Artificial Intelligence, a field now getting more attention than ever. Isaacson rightly points out how singularity is "always 20 years away". A fair reason to be skeptical about any eureka's being thrown around. That being said, the field of AI has progressed dramatically since the release of this book in 2014. Since then, breakthroughs in Reinforcement learning, Natural Language Processing and Image Recognition have been nibbling away at the corner of human dominated fields. This is also the reason for my skepticism for the human-computer symbiosis. A partnership where "we let the machines do what they do best, and they let us do what we do best" (p448) becomes less interesting when the latter is an increasingly smaller field. The key human property of creativity and the ability to connect the dots are still safe from silicon, but the siege has definitely begun. That only makes the future more exciting... who knows what a book like this will reflect on in 50 years?
Recounts (mostly well-known) success stories of innovation, something that will always excite me.Falls short of giving a convincing description of when innovation works.Last section, on the bright future of China's innovation, seems to me a bit shortsighted. There is a significant burden of proof when claiming that China is "free" on the level of the entrepreneur, and that burden is not met.
The only thing Kaczynski was certainly right about is that he needed to kill people before anyone would care about this absolute mid piece of Societal Theory. Embarrassing really
Kate raworth shows she has a good understanding of all the immense problems with our economy, but this book lacks convincing solutions to fight them.what i liked:* shows the problem of eternal growth that is very effectively hidden in our status quo worldview* the donut is a great concept, although not practical, and ingrains the need for an 'embedded' economy with elegantlywhat i didn't like:* not enough elaboration on some possible solutions/lack of pragmatic solutions* anecdotal evidence; general proof by showing example
Fine summary of the geopolitics of major nations. However, I dislike the thesis the title and subtitle suggest. Ten maps don't tell you everything you need to know, on the contrary, you need to understand many historical and cultural factors to understand a region's situation. In a way, this book is a list of all the examples of this. Imperialist borders that ignore geography that explain unrest, how religion causes tension between countries, the military enforcement of a sphere of influence far from a nation's border: all examples of the defiance of geographical determinism. Should the book be called "Prisoners of History" or "Prisoners of Culture" then? No, for the same reason "Prisoners of Geography" misses the point. It is all three and even more factors that determine a nations geopolitical stance.All in all, geography clearly plays an important role (I mean, what are countries if not just denotations on a map?), and if you forgot that fact through the misleading perspective of globalism, this book is a good reminder.
Martha Gellhorn, I wish we had more woman like her!
I read this book over and over. So many times. The book is so good and sad at the same time. I read many books by Hemmingway after this book and about the lost generation in Paris in the roaring '20s
Must read. Chills everywhere. I think the ending was very strong.Nothing made up. Learn from history, for God sake!
'I'm thinking that it must be loveIt's too late to be gratefulIt's too late to be late againIt's too late to be hateful'- David Bowie
It's a good retelling, but I feel like for a book called The Silence of the Girls to have 30/40% of the book told from Achilles' perspective is kind of lame. I want to learn more about Briseïs, not Achilles who I've already read so much about! It's a great book, but not as woman-centered as I would've wished.
I wish it was longer. Penelopeia really deserves a full-length novel :]
Great story and writing but it's hard to remember all of the different names, especially with the perspective switches. This book would have really benefitted from a character glossary in the back of the book, hopefully the next book will have one :)
best of the myrmidons... screaming crying shaking sobbing
"He is half of my soul, as the poets say" - The Song of Achilles"I tried to picture myself running up and down the beaches, tearing at my hair, cradling some scrap of old tunic he had left behind. Crying out for the loss of half my soul." - CirceDIT BOEK is half mijn ziel nee FUCK de helft dit boek is MIJN HELE ZIEL
rock n roll baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"What does it matter, when nothing we do makes any difference?"A good story held back by uninteresting or sometimes (even for mythology) unrealistic character writing. Especially not a fan of the dynamic between Briseïs, Achilles and Patroclus. The writing isn't very special, but the worldbuilding is great and the way ancient Greek perception of time and Gods are handled are great.
this is my first time reading a graphic novel and GOD what a gorgeous artstyle. sometimes it's like a modernized take on ancient vase paintings and it's SO nice to look at. super colorful and vibrant. it looks amazing (i really love the cover too!!). the story is really compelling (as is natural with greek mythology), and i love this interpretation of greek mythology characters :]
** spoiler alert ** Bowlesy, where did you go wrong? After three strikes of 5 stars for his first three novels, he missteps here. He said this was his favorite self-penned novel. Set in Central America, this reminded me more of his excellent short stories, than his monumental existentalist novels taking place in North Africa. How I yearned back for Morocco! Bowles expertly portrays a husband and wife bickering in a perilous country, but the reader does not get too know them too intimately. They never gaze at the stars for long enough (figuratively speaking) to allow a deep dife, to really feel their existential angst, their sense of purposelessness. Not even a few brilliant psychedelic chapters could bump this up to 5 stars. Not because the trips were bad, but because the plot is spoiled by an antihero too powerful, who is too handsome, too rich and too cunning, so that I found myself suspended from suspense. Too many characters are given the literary microphone, without any great payoff. An amazing little tale of suspenseful tarrying, that runs ashore in a jungle stupor of hang ups.
It was ok. I liked the chapter where she got to know her little brother most, it seemed the most genuine. All the sex fantasies with Jim Morrison, Mick Jagger and Jimi Hendrix were quite tedious. I wish the author wrote about the times when the girl loved the parties still! The book never manages to get behind the reasons of Felicity no longer enjoying parties, and every time you think the book's getting out of shallow waters for a bit deeper dive, it hits another rock and there's pages of sexual experiences again. This was an exercise in redundancy.
Shocking tale of humans getting by in a Mumbai slum, surviving mainly by collecting trash (why did I think this method existed mainly in Africa?). It's very touching to read about families holding on to their sense of humanity in a cripplingly corrupt caste-ridden society, where capital always supercedes the most sincere or convincing arguments, where little children wake up with sores on their faces due to rats biting them at night. Yikes!
Don't you just love it when something you absolutely adored ends prematurely, leaving you somewhat unsatisfied, and later you find there's more yummy goodness to guzzle your reading eyes on? That's exactly this book for anyone who ever read Jaroslav Hasek's masterpiece "The Good Soldier Švejk". This book will show you a little of what could have been if the circumstances were more accommodating to the author, a few great series of short stories that you can read as other chapters in Svejk's life, the prototype stories of Svejk and some more autobiographical elements that put the writing process of the masterpiece into perspective. On its own, without the context "The Good Soldier Svejk", I would probably not give it 5 stars so that's why it gets 4.
Graves writes a compelling autobiography but sometimes it's a bit boring, especially after he return from the war.
The opening chapter bored me to tears. The second chapter got me hooked and interested; an extremely interesting background story to the family (spoilers: a childhood spent with American parents not at the top of the economic ladder in Panama and Ecuador). After that it just slowly died out, mostly owing to way too much detailed storytelling. So many sequences were either uninteresting or didn't help to "color in" the imagery in new and refreshing ways. Could have been a great book with some heavy editing. Stopped reading at around page 250, when it became clear the rest of the book was a tunnel with no light at the end.
Down in the Parisian dumps, this guy still makes his life worth living! Somehow it all feels quite non-fictional. If you like books with their own special flavour, read this! I'm not the best reviewer, I know. This is already a little too much attention on me so I'll cut it off here.
Not my kind of book, wayyyy too boring but that's what you get in the English countryside, long long ago. However boring life maybe, the book portrays the emotions of the central characters beautifully. Made me a feel a bit like I understand religious peasants more.
Nothing worth your time here. The anecdotes, which are the only thing of interest, are wayyy too far between. Found it for 1 euro, but still feels like a waste :-)
Reads as if you only have the audiotapes of criminals talking to an undercover agent. While this makes a very realistic portrayal (words can only be interpreted in so few ways), you will be left wondering what the hell happened. Most books pull the reader in, this one leaves you a bystander far removed from the action.
** spoiler alert ** What can I say? This novel delicately touches on the potential for human change, resistance to such change and compassionate mercy.Somewhere in the Catskills (did I pick this up to read up on pre-Woodstock history? I don't recall.) a very humane society exist, in diametric opposition to life in the city. Travelers passing through are taken up instantly, occupying a seat in most folks' minds. Henry Soames, running a shabby little diner, just can't bring himself to stop being the most helpful, self-sacrificing guy around, even though he neglects his physique enormously. There's a lot to love in this book. I had to deduct a star because I felt there were one too many premature deaths (2) that heighten suspense disconsonantly. Besides a few climactic moments it was a perfect ``uneventful'' (yet full of shimmering dialogue) novel to read with my cluttered mind.
** spoiler alert ** I always look up any books mentioned in the ones I read - intertextuality is a mighty tool for finding new stuff to read. A few months ago I read this obscure novel, M.E. White's In the Balance There's a passage in this book describing the main character picking up a novel that enthralled her in less distressing times: ``I turned on another light and opened boxes until I found one that contained The Confidence Man. Sitting down, I began to read it again. Pausing at the finger-smudged section on the metaphysics of Indian hating, my eyes ran down lines that I had long ago underlined, but no longer knew quite why. At the back of the book there was a list of characters in one column, then an equals sign followed by a blank. It was headed: ``The Balance."Well, just like Baylor, I underscored many lines in that chapter. Just like I did in all the other ones. Of all the books in my collection, The Confidence-Man contains by far the most underscoring and notes. The language is just perfect for my comprehension of English at this moment in time. I have to look up some words, but never too many. I always felt people were more literate before the 20th century. I had to contain myself so much from looking up who was who on this Mississippi steamboat. Thankfully my review now remains pure and original. The book delves deep on what it means to have trust in someone - very relevant today and forever. A truly wacky tale on a sprawling ship.
Sex, violence and no rock-n-roll.
I cannot get through this book. I loved V by the same author, but this was too goofy for my taste. Secret agents are almost always a buzzkill for me, especially in more improbable situations. I think Pynchon lost his touch after the hiatus.
For once in your life accept that you don't know what all the little designations on a ship or a submarine mean, just like you wouldn't understand any terminology if you walked into a chemical lab. There, you're all set to read this absolutely fantastic novel. You may need to start over a few time and expand your reading stamina, but boooooy is this worth it. A novel about the changing human condition, a genius at work.
** spoiler alert ** Human rights sure were different in ancient China! Judge Dee, both judge and criminal investigator, does not shy away from extreme torture to extract confessions from his suspects. Oh well. There are some interesting sequences, especially when the investigation seems to halt at a dead end, only for the ghost of the murder victim to appear and accuse their spouse. Or Dee receives cryptic poetry from another realm in his sleep, which helps him solve the cases. Ultimately, the story does bog down in the second half. Towards the end, I was sprinting through the pages, not caring anymore about Dee or the victims, who are all executed.
Came to this after "Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas", a book I thoroughly enjoyed. It read like a backstory to the wacky Samoan attorney, full of questions of identity, racism, dropping out and of course, plenty of drugs and alcohol. The racial hardships described are very poignant and shattering. My only criticism is that it's a bit short, but hopefully the 'story' picks up just where it's left off in the other book. I haven't read much literature by Chicanos; this was a great first introduction. I will definitely pick up the other book Acosta managed to finish before his disappearance. ps. the foreword by Thompson is nothing special.
A nice little book, that reads like a saga of the old days in a TV show like "The Wire". It was never destined for greatness, but it has a gripping style that evokes the gritty, heroin-infused wasteland in black neighborhoods. This writer knew what was going on and wasn't afraid to take a closer look in rickety buildings where rent is paid to the largest muscles around. I think the story was a little shaky near the end, as is so often the case with great buildups. Shit happens. I would put it somewhere in the middle between literary fiction and a genre crime novel. Not quite there, but close. You could read it on holiday easily and have loads of fun with it.13/12/2023 Just browsing through, and wanted to add that the abandoned (office?) building the dealers work out of is brilliantly described, I still remember it clearly.
If only this journal was edited a bit more! The first few chapters are golden. After that some incoherence seeps in, when it is becoming vital to bind all words together. Some chapters could have been thrown out altogether. Still, there are remarkable passages on the spiritual journey embarked on by these pioneers. Read in October 2022 in Amsterdam.
** spoiler alert ** Came across this because a lady was reading this in sunny Saigon in Robert Stone’s 1974 novel “Dog Soldiers”, my favorite book of all time. It was decent, though very predictable at times. I liked the first half of the book most, after it’s just straight reading through it. The medical jargon is not jarring and adds to the realism. I’m a little conflicted on Doctor Manson’s expertise; in the later stages he mentions that he knew almost nothing about medicine when he had just finished his education, but the opening chapters demonstrate he is a master doctor and will inevitably rise as high as a he wants. He almost never makes a mistake or is uncertain about an illness. I don’t know enough about medicine to make an authoritative judgment on this, but it seems our Andrew is a little too infallible. Looking back, I feel as though Andrew is a tad boring person, just as I would expect any doctor to be. Someone mentioned here that it’s their favorite book; I think that person should read more :)
My biggest issue with most of the stories is that Wolfe forgets to include himself, the journalist/reporter as a participating actor in the events. Without this element, a lot of stories just seem boring. I don't think this collection of essays adds up to more than the sum of its parts, so I will give ratings (out of 10) for each of them individually. Anything below 5.5 on my scale qualifies as 'unreadable' to various extents. [ Las Vegas (What?) Las Vegas (Can't Hear You! Too Noisy) Las Vegas!!!! - 9 ]Great fun, which unfortunately sets the standard a little too high for the rest of the book. [ Clean Fun at Riverhead - 7.5 ]I think I rated this high because I was still surfing high on the previous story. The story about demolition derbies is fun, but forgettable in the end. [ The Fifth Beatle - 6 ] Here is where the book starts to become quite boring. I think it has to with generous allocation of paragraphs for individual famous people like this DJ guy. I put the book down a few times from this point on, something I would not have expected after the first two stories. [ The Peppermint Lounge Revisited - 6.5 ] Marginally more interesting than the previous story, but ultimately doesn't excite much. Forgettable description of a forgettable phenomenon. [ The First Tycoon of Teen - 5 ] I had to skip over several sections of this one. It was just way too boring and stretched. It's obvious now that I have a bad taste for famous people in this book. Wolfe just doesn't bring enough exciting things to the table. [ The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby - 6 ] The namesake of the collection; I had high hopes, especially after the poor run of the last few stories. I skipped over a few sections because it was too long and boring and I couldn't get through it and I didn't want to put the book down again. Some interesting stuff about car modification and the world around it, but dragged out elements hinder the flow too much. About five pages would have been enough. [ The Marvelous Mouth - 5.5 ]Another celebrity showcase, this time it's Cassius Clay. This one barely managed to hold my attention. It's becoming clear Wolfe includes every note he takes in the story. For the substance this story has, I think 3-4 pages is the maximum. [ The Last American Hero - 7.5 ]Great, but filled with boring filler.[ Loverboy of the Bourgeoisie - 7.5 ]Not great, but not too long either. I think this length suits the less interesting stories very well, and plenty of them would have scored higher if they were shorter like this. [ Purveyor of the Public Life - ? 7 I guess] I forgot to jot down a score for this one. It's cool, this Harrison guy is famous but actually DOES something and is passionate about it. He's not trying to be famous. He's trying to be accomplished in something that's looked down upon. Plus points for going someplace with them, this is heading more into Gonzo journalism that I love when done right. [ The Girl of the Year - 8 ] Baby Jane the number one girl this year because she's cool like that. While this is also about a single individual, I think it's much more exciting than say, the Fifth Beatle. [ The Saturday Route - 6.5 ] While done well, I think the subject matter is not very interesting. All these pretentious high class people are not cool, man! Thankfully, it's not too long. [ The Luther of Columbus Circle - 7 ] Now here's a pretentious high class guy that also tries to do his own thing, setting up an art colony and stuff like that. He's alright. [ The New Art Gallery Society - 8 ] Finally another story with a fitting length, the Museum of Modern Art reopening extravaganza. Wolfe offers valuable insights in the pretentiousness of the whole thing. Could have been improved if he placed himself in the story and got some more interesting quotes. [ The Secret Vice - 7.5 ] A nice, cute story about male silliness. These are the kinds of topics that Wolfe shines through. While not extremely interesting, I rate it highly because of how well the author pulls off such a banal topic. [ The Nanny Mafia - 7.5 ] I wonder how Wolfe got to know about this phenomenon. It seems terrifyingly awful! Imagine being rich and then forced to get a nanny like one of these! [ Putting Daddy On - 8.5 ] A clashing of cultures! This is a wonderful story with Wolfe himself one of the primary figures. I love it. The chasm between Parker and his son is unbridgeable. [ A Sunday Kind of Love - 7.5 ] Necking in the depths of the subway, that's Love! I liked this for the insight it gave me on how nice a day Sunday is in the excruciating business of New York. [ The Woman Who Has Everything - 5 ] I skipped over this one, I don't know why exactly but I did. It was another boring story that contrasted too much with the lovely goodness surrounding it. [ The Voices of Village Square - 7.5 ] A fine example of a quirky, random phenomenon that is worth writing about. I wish Wolfe explored more exactly why this detention center is so repulsive. Now it sounds like a lot of fun. [ Why Doormen Hate Volkswagens - 8.5 ]An awesome story about a regular guy who qualifies for the embodiment of lower class NYC hustling. And finally a great gonzo moment at the very end: "The cabbie stares at Roy and then he looks at me with that quizzical, sempiternal New York cab driver look that asks the impartial judge, "Who the hell is this nut?"[ The Big League Complex - 8 ] I think writers like Wolfe and Thompson are at their best on broader, sociological topics. This is a good example of that. Wolfe combines several stories into one larger message here, something that should've been done with earlier stories as well (or he should have discarded them - oh well, he was writing for a living). ----------------As a general review, I will give it four stars because there were a lot of interesting stories that I wouldn't have like to miss (everything I gave 8+). Unfortunately, there is some very boring stuff here, the omission of which would have greatly enhanced the overall quality. If you want to read this book, read only the things I gave a 7 or higher. Kind regards, Beer
I cannot bring myself to finish this. Having left it halfway done, I now sincerely tried to plow through. Unfortunately there is almost nothing of interest here. Nothing to bring a smile to my face ever sprang up. On occasion there were some mildly interesting discussions on philosophy and physics, but thrown in carelessly without any relation to plot. All the characters are basically unlikeable. What was the author thinking? I think there is some talented writer behind this, but oh boy did he miss the mark here.I'm all for taking structural and narrative liberties, but please put them to other uses than bad jokes!
** spoiler alert ** Forgot where I found out about this book, but the synopsis started something like this:``Guy works as an engineer for dam construction in 1950s former Dutch Indies colony.''That has nothing to do with 90% of the book, which is spent in one of the most contrived settings ever, with two of the most boring characters ever. This guy is some sort of James Bond, always conveniently eavesdropping, coincidentally being in the middle of everything without any reason, unreasonably offering his life multiple times for a prostitute who he loves so much, that when they are waiting for a few hours, all they do is play cards (instead of getting to know each other, philosophize, whatever). Maybe a 12 y/o around 1956 would have loved this, but the glorification of combat (while not intriguingly described) just adds up to a whole load of nothing. I should have known, when I got the first edition hardcover at garbage bin price. I don't often finish books I'll rate with one star, but this was thin, easy to read and sort of made me feel better about my own writing. I mean, if this got published to at least some acclaim, I have chances to get published too.
** spoiler alert ** After reading "Panic in Needle Park" by this author, I was willing to try this book. For some reason I thought it was a fictionalization of Bob Leuci's shenanigans (see Prince of the City).The layout of the book is quite experimental. The first dozen pages or so consist of authentic-looking police records, which help setting the mystery atmosphere of the story. The variety of those records, reports, interview transcripts and journalistic pieces give you the sense of browsing through a big (curated) police folder. So for the first third of the book, I was holding a solid 4 star book in my hands.Unfortunately, the characters gradually possess increasingly perfect memory of the events, this releasing authenticity. Worse yet, the events spiral towards a boring standoff in an elevator between the cop and the bad guy. This set piece drags on for far too long, and is hampered by the lack of proper acquaintance with the characters. I simply didn't care what would happen in that elevator, and skimmed through the third third which devolved in a tediously boring thriller.
[SPOILERS] After "Dog Soldiers", one of my favorite books of all time, I was hungry for more. Unfortunately, this first work by Stone is a bit disappointing. It starts off well, interesting down on their luck characters that have their own ways to deal with the oppressive system. I think it could have done without the last third of the book (the whole stadium scene is too improbable) and have more fleshed out characters, especially Geraldine. Thankfully, Stone learned from this effort and improved dramatically in his follow-up.
This was the first book I ever read in English (not my first language) and I remember not remembering very much of it. There was this colonial official that always had his chin lifted a bit, so I tried doing that when I talked to people myself. Not sure what feeling my interlocutors got from that. Perhaps I'll read it again, it seemed like an honest portrayal of Mr. Johnson in colonial Nigeria.
DNF: Although the Amsterdam setting obviously drew me to this, I put it down after a couple of reading sessions. It's very constructed, clichéd story with a protagonist who isn't worth a damn. He's so boring! Why would anyone enjoy reading about someone like this. What is his motivation? Why should the reader care? The antagonists (smack dealers) are simply evil and our hero is simply good. No backstory, no suspense, no nothing.
Everyone read this for English because it was by far the shortest book on the reading list. Very boring, doesn't tell you anything interesting.The title makes me think of that masterpiece "Berlin Alexanderplatz" by Alfred Döblin.
Some books are too short, some are too long. This one belongs to the latter category. While some situations are humorous, they often take an exaggerated tone, breaking the immersion. Most of all the book was boring. I've got to give it that it has an idiosyncratic style. Not recommended.
All reviewers who say this book is trash because of the racism/sexism/colonialism are modern-day bigots. Only by reading such literature can one realize the extent of such latent racism. Moreover, the characters in the book are clearly not extremely racist, with one even falling in love with a native. They merely state such a love would not be possible in the Britain of that day, obviously due to attitudes of the time. If the characters were uncharacteristic of their time (which they are somewhat), the author would have to go out of his way to explain how they came to be so non-racist. The raw and unveiled racism/sexism/etc. are the only redeeming qualities the book has now, because for the rest it's an excessively violent young boys book about almost dying plenty of times. Without those qualities, I would rate the book lower. With them, they provide valuable insight in the attitudes of that day. If you cannot look past that and must evaluate everything with the current attitudes, I daresay you are a bigot yourself. As for the rest of the book, there were some passages of note: "Listen! what is life ? It is a feather, it is the seed of the grass, blown hither and tither, sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act, sometimes carried away into the heavens. But if the seed be good and heavy it may perchance travel a little way the road it wills. It is well to try and journey one's road and to fight with the air. Man must die. At the worst he can but die a little sooner. I will go with thee across the desert and over the mountains, unless perchance I fall to the ground on the way, my father." --Umbopa, p.60Unfortunately, I almost completely lost interest in the narrative after the gang reached beyond the mountains into Kukuanaland. From then on, every move was predictable and not very interesting. I hoped for an adventure in the wilderness, not some random isolated civilization going to civil war.. For this turn of events I cannot give the book more than 3 stars. I would have given it 2 stars, but the racism was insightful enough to add 1.Edit 19/02/23:I have to take down a star. This book serves well only as grandfather to unoriginal adventure plots. I had a beautiful old copy from around 1900, which added a star in my mind, I realize in retrospect.
Enthralling, captivating, excruciating - brilliant. A grimy urban nightmare seemingly devoid of hope is the stage for so many tragic, short lives. The authors visited the worst crack dens and needle palaces in Western Baltimore, bringing the reader to hell. The narrative is punctuated with sublimely timed sociological and political observations, stretching the depth of hopelessness through state institutions and programmes and the characters futility in reaching them. I have never been caught unawares of my emotions to such an extent that I just broke down and started crying during (view spoiler)[the inauguration of the community garden, when Ella's daughter was also honored. (hide spoiler)] The raw emotion in this book captured so poignantly, so lucid, it's impossible to take any position other than compassionate understanding. I enjoyed this non-fiction work even more than Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets.
A nice little new-journalism book, but drags on a little too much in places. Still, enjoyed reading it. I wish there was more stuff about the hippies, but it's almost as though Norman was more busy keeping notes than actually talking to people. Perhaps it's hard to find that balance in the field.
The first portion of the book carves out a very extensive philosophical / existential basis, to which is referred during the interviews. This gives the sometimes superficial talks some depth, besides psychological commentary. It works. The reason I don't especially love the book is because of the three main interviewees, only one was engagingly interesting to me. And there were a bunch of short stories ('cameos') that included much more interesting people that I would have loved to hear more from.
Las Vegas in the good old times baby! This book made me want to do drugs.
** spoiler alert ** Oh boy, I had a dynamite blast reading this! Howard Street is not a place I would ever like to visit, but to read about it is to indulge in the workings of a strange society where all behaviour is geared towards reputation. I was reminded of the many non-cool people in Amsterdam riding Vespa scooters and wearing Canada Goose jackets. Underneath the rough life - mostly in dark times of the day - that is much of the stage, there are wonderful characters speeching about the condition of the people that populate Howard Street. The disillusioned one-year college student-basketballer Jackie who lets down his most ardent admirer Jimmie gives many answers, but not enough. Then there's Hip, who just wants to be left alone and not hurt anybody (except the girls he's pimping), spouting his radical nihilism of junk-sensation. The tales of the grimy streets are original and classic, but the deeper intellectual discussions shining through on occasion lift this book to the 5 star joy-to-read shelf. Read in December 2022 in Amsterdam, mostly at my place in my comfy chair and in bed next to my lovely fiancee.
The novel starts of great with plenty of cool action sequences. Intro- and retrospection then gradually take the stage, with some truly profound and original insights in the disadvantaged experience. A joy to read, but felt somewhat unfinished.
I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this. This is one of the books that reward you for digging as deep as you can in the mountains of forgotten books. Schaap has the perfect journalistic voice to bring out this true-crime story with just the right amount of contextual information plugged in at the right moments. Truly a great book, perhaps not astounding as pure literature, but definitely a very strong and evocative book. Perfect for a short holiday.To give a notion of how much I enjoyed it, this is one of the books with the most lines underscored by me. There are so many awesome quotes and one-liners. But then again, I've got a knack for this kind of stuff. Still, I seldom read true-crime / non-fiction and I loved this! (Kinda similar to this, also great, would be "Prince of the City", by Robert Daley.)
Bored by rhetoric and repetition, unwilling to go backward and unable to locate “forward,” the youth movement seems to be grinding to an uneasy halt, to be boiling down to a skeptical “What next?” For many, the trip is over and they haven't arrived at a destination. They are like hitchhikers who have been let out in the middle of nowhere.This was such a nice and easy book to read in the evenings. My studies are getting a little tough, so I'm glad I wasn't reading "Under the Volcano" or some heavyweight like that. Sure enough, Stickney is not the best writer ever. Some passages he tries to polish the chalice up a bit, but he doesn't seem to have the talent or true motivation. What makes it work regardless is that he lets shine through his own depressed state of mind occasionally. He wants the counterculture to live on, but just doesn't see it happening. This in fact quite a gonzo journalism book, with the author centering as the figurehead of the book and visiting all kinds of "longhairs" (thankfully he doesn't employ the word "hippie"). From his conversations with the longhairs it becomes apparent most of them have no focus, no plans and no real alternative to society. Except of course the people in communes. Anyway, this is a vast expanse of counterculture goodness that you'll love if you're into this stuff.
** spoiler alert ** The title of this book had been stuck in my head for a long time. It's so catchy! Margaret uses the line almost every chapter, so I think it's come loose now. As for the rest, it's a surprisingly pleasant read, especially given its accessibility to younger readers. It's simple and breezy, not basic. Religion is the main theme, and it shines bright. Can you choose a religion? Or can it only be spoon-fed to you as a baby? I wonder what it would (have) be(en) like to read this as a 12-year old kid. . .
I was put onto this book by Hunter Thompson, who mentioned it in an article:"Just before talking to Burgin, in fact, I read a savage novel called North Dallas Forty, by ex-Cowboy flanker Pete Gent, and it had cranked up my interest in both Dallas and the Cowboys enough so that I was right on the brink of dumping Oakland and heading for Texas."To my surprise, I found this book to be very moving, quirky, perceptive, grim and focused, with plenty of little scattered observations on Dallas around 1970. I love it because there's a tremendous sense of dystopia. Orwell's 1984 is great and all, I prefer to read about actual existing dystopiae. This is one of those books where you get that feeling of hopelessness in a world of extreme capitalism, racism and physical abuse. The atmosphere of fear and pain, the sense of detachment from one's broken body, the constant abuse of uppers and downers, the team going out at night, the dialogues and idiosyncracies of pro-football; this book was a joy to read and I finished it in a few days.
A deeply moving existential novel about a poor buck, Joe Buck. Too easily do we readers, with above average intelligence, frown upon stupidities in novels ("Oh that's just too stupid to believe."). Joe Buck knows the cards he's dealt. He just needs some advice, someone to guide him. Imagine being born and growing up in a 1940s brothel to an unknown father. He tries, and he tries, but he just can't get himself together. He doesn't even know how to talk to people. He's almost a caricature, but some excellent introspective passages delicately show him for the human being that he is. Through a succintly written naturalistic growing-up part, the book gets you rooting for Joe Buck all the way. He's such a nice guy, and you don't want anything bad to happen to him. Unfortunately for him, in 1960s USA (as today, no doubt), that same entity that made you scared in the dark is forever lurking for your happiness.
I try not to read books with any sort of expectation of greatness. Books like Stoner receive a great deal of mention, so that the expectation value (hi there Quantum Mechanics! plug the operator between two complex conjugated and normalized wave functions etc - although in QM expectation value means 'average', not the value with the highest probability. The field of physics is so rotten linguistically!) got bumped up quite a bit without my interference.For many years I refused to pick this up, since I was devastated this supposedly great novel was not about some stoner getting high. Instead, we get a similarly lethargic (but not as intriguing to me) glimpse at the English faculty of the University of Missouri. It's kind of a naturalistic novel, following Stoner from birth to death. This is one of my least favorite genres, since it seemingly hollows out characters to a sparse selection of noteworthy events. This guy's whole life in 300 pages! Some novels take more pages for just one day, and are far more literary and intriguing (Joyce's Ulysses comes to mind - I want to read that this year!)Ultimately, there are not enough interesting things going on for me in Stoner's life. He just lets everything pass by, fails to recognize potential adversaries in his life and pays the price for his ignorance. The characters talk about the university as a sanctuary from the harsh life on the outside, but fail to integrate anything they read into their own lives. Tragic, perhaps, but what is the point of committing your life to literature if you don't have experience deep passions due to it?Stoner is neither lengthy nor hard to digest. But a presumed commitment to literary greatness in such a stripped down manner is almost blasphemy to me. Shouldn't Stoner have just gone to 1920s Greenwich Village with the poets and bohemians? That sounds much more like the sanctuary he needed. Regardless, Stoner was a very pleasant read, I literally breezed through it. The conflicts with other members of the faculty were sublimely handled. I would recommend the book if you enjoy naturalism and dealing with perishing. I haven't read many English department novels, but have heard they are innumerable and for the most part insufferable. One example of literary greatness set at such a faculty can be found between the covers of The Hair of Harold Roux.
I picked this up because I wanted to read more about the Brotherhood of Eternal Love (Orange Sunshine: The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and Its Quest to Spread Peace, Love, and Acid to the World). I did not have high expectations, because it is a memoir. The only memoir I ever loved is Robert Graves' Goodbye to All That. The author is a daring gung-ho guy. After working for the CIA in 1960s Laos and Thailand, he now accepted a tenure as international drug agent in Afghanistan. This is where a lot of the West Coast hashish was coming from at the time. Afghanistan was still a kingdom, and also very corrupt. Police let everyone go with a bribe, and they don't even get weapons because they would sell them. Their wage was about a dollar a month, so go figure. In comes Mr. Burke (kind of evil-sounding), an apt name of one of Nixon's cronies, just like Hunt, Liddy, Barker. He is not letting anyone off the hook. And this is where the book shines: even though he moves to Kabul with wife and four kids, he has absolutely no scruples about eavesdropping, going undercover, setting up deals, all on his own, without even really knowing the country. Burke has an unmistakeable talent for being a top-level agent, and knows how to always be one step ahead, to always brandish lethal force when needed, and to never let his guard down. Why is he so motivated for this dangerous job? Well, he seems convinced he's doing the Lord's work. While his inner thoughts and emotions don't often manifest in the book, when they do, he comes across as a very right-wing, almost fascist person, who believes that America is great and that all these people smuggling hashish (now legalized in California!) are evil scum, since they are engaged in 'illegal activities'. He also cannot help but write about his disdain for developing countries and their antics. Oh well, I guess you have to hold some hatred in your soul for this job. Thankfully, Burke refrains from bragging too much about his accomplishments, although he does not reflect much on his actions. After all, he is following orders. And from that perspective can the book be best enjoyed. Here is an international drug agent with incredible talent for the job, and plenty of thrilling stories to share. Variety arrives in the second half of the book in the form of contact with the Soviets and a visit to Moscow, and the serendipitous arrival of Timothy Leary and Joanna Harcourt-Smith (Tripping the Bardo with Timothy Leary: My Psychedelic Love Story). Insights into the Brotherhood of Eternal Love were minor. Most importantly, Burke met up with one strung-out, strapped-for-cash-and-starving member in Kabul who basically gave up lots of pillars of the organization. Other than that, it was interesting to read about this stop on the old-school Hippie Trail, with what Burke calles "world-travelers", and where they hung out and what kind of perils they met on the road to Salvation.
Non-fiction reporting books almost never tell a balanced story, and neither does this one. I think Schou did a great job with the possibilities handed to him, and so long after the facts. These people were all in their 60s at least! The objective style of writing was comforting, and made for an easy read. I loved how the hippies thought the universe aligned when people showed up with limber and built a stage in the canyon, while the cops assert that it was undercover guys that did it to prevent chaos from erupting :-)The story of the Brotherhood of Eternal Love ultimately did not match the expectations set by me. I set the bar pretty high I suppose. Still, I wish there was more about the manufacturing of Orange Sunshine, and more stories of how the Brotherhood tried to spread Peace, Love and Acid. Although the Maui period was amazing, I can't wait to see the movie "Rainbow Bridge" with Jimi Hendrix. And the book suffers from the omission of voices like Johnny Gale. In the end, this is a great prologue to Joanna Harcourt-Smith's "My Psychedelic Love Story".
Great insight in Arab
What a title! I found this book on a book list of a Utah native newspaper, and I was intrigued by the Mormons living their own way over there.For the first third or so of the novel, I was wholly engrossed in the characters, this guy with 4 wives and over 30 kids spread over three houses. I hoped all of the family members would take the mic at some point or other, but about halfway through I realized I was only going to get a few characters in all, with most of the kids missing out on coming clean with their feelings. This realization, combined with overlong, drawn out flashbacks and solo adventures that did not relate to the other family members other than "I don't want to go home", made me put the book down, which is a shame because I liked the writing style a lot. Another 300 pages with no surprises would be a waste of my short time here on earth...Perhaps some day I'll finish it on holiday or something, but there were better books waiting in line..
Not worth your time, although it was marginally better than The Godfather.
Let me preface this review with saying that true crime is something I have really enjoyed at times, but I just haven't figured out how to find interesting material. Most of the true crime books I've read over the past few months have come from an Amazon reviewer that enjoyed one of my favorite true crimes: "Turned On" by Dick Schaap. Naturally I've got "In Cold Blood" waiting for the perfect moment. SPOILERSMeanwhile, this book was quite breezy to read, almost too easy. The backgrounds of the people were mildly interesting at best. I liked reading about McGowan's messups all over and how the bureaucrazy can allow for a monster to stay in police. However, there were so many boring contributions from minor characters - e.g. every character got a page reacting to the death of Susan White. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not brilliantly written and the information endowed with the words doesn't tickle my And then the court case is completely superfluous and poorly done - I skipped over at least 60 of the last 90 pages.
Wanted to read this years ago but I saw the movie recently (then) so I wanted to wait some time to wash the imagery away. It's a very demanding book, up there with the Ulysseses and Berlin Alexanderplatzes, though in a very different setting. There are so many references to obscure English poetry that will fly over your head; still you will plough on till the end. Making the wrong choices over and over and over will bring you irretrievably down spiritually. Throw a boatload of alcohol in the mix. That's infernal hell indeed. Few books have made me cry, and even fewer have made me cry multiple times. There's something about plunging into the mental abyss, despite common rational sense, that hits so close to home for me. Though my own paths to destruction are different and of varying steepness, every day I still pass them by. While getting through the book sometimes felt like doing homework(I used this resource for annotations: https://www.otago.ac.nz/english-lingu...), I don't think any book has ever resonated as emotionally with me. For sophisticates.
My fondest memory of this book is when I was waiting for my departure in Luton Airport (London). It was one of those no-frisk airports, where there were very few seats available for waiting. Thus I decided to have a meal at a fancy restaurant (the flight was dirt cheap). Traveling alone, I reached for this book to enjoy while I waited. Several times I burst out laughing aloud because of Svejk. After some time, people came up to me to ask what book this was - my laughter was contagious :) While very funny, it is also very grim. This balances out and helps maintain immersion. A must-read before you []
** spoiler alert ** Revisiting Chandler after some years (The Big Sleep was one of my first voluntarily read novels), I was very interested how I would respond to the second in the series. Somewhere online I found a ranking of Chandler's works, in which this was listed #1. I loved the Big Sleep, so I guess I had quite high hopes for this. The first half of the book had me on a leash, but whem the plot thickens it loses steam. I suppose some readers adore the focus on style, but for me the story was too disjointed, too implausible for a pleasant mystery ride. For me, the quality of the plot is essential in a mystery story. Unfortunately the quality found here is not impeccable. Marlowe meets just the right person at just the right place and time, while following up a baseless hunch. The plot was not hard to follow this time around, while in the Big Sleep I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on. I liked the discussions about clues and suspects between Marlowe and various characters. But for me the sense that Marlowe was on an amusement park ride, sometimes a little drunk, without much sense of autonomous directing, was too large to become fully engrossed in the mystery. The mystery itself also fell a bit short compared to the previous book. Maybe I have matured as a reader, maybe the Big Sleep is superior. I will revisit that one day.
This was a pretty interesting book about a preacher who decided to bring Jesus to the runaways, hippies, bikers etc. of the Sunset Strip around 1967. Above all a decent document of the times from the perspective of a very religious person who not only met Jesus but also has so much faith in the Holy Trinity (although the Holy Spirit doesn't get a shoutout) that virtually all his problems get solved, since his problems are also His problems apparently. The Bible quotes are sometimes a bit much though, and Blessitt (what a name!) also fails to mention how he got rid of his urine while fasting on a cross for 4 weeks. Missed chance, man!
** spoiler alert ** I had no idea this would be a book about male prostitution in the 50s/early 60s when I got it. And I really enjoyed it (regardless?). It's not graphic sexually, but there's tons of great innuendos. I loved following him into the nightly parks and shady bars, all the way up to New Orleans when I felt the book was repeating itself. I didn't actually finish the book, it became a little bit of drag, even though I only I had less than 50 pages to go. It's such fine yet accessible writing, it kept me glued to the book. And now my mind thinks of what substance that glue must be in this book :0
Lookin' fer a Holy Grail of psychedelic literature!? This might be it for you, right here. This might make all your searchin' worth your while. Check out this introduction, man, and let go of preconceptions, resistances, etc. and let yourself be pulled in. I cannot spoil the story, that would spoil the book. Think that's far-out/fetched? Sure, but it works. This is a thoroughly researched, lavish work, with impeccable referencing. Those tedious university hours spent reading boring articles and writing sloppy essays were MEANINGFUL! [^ Clubs here meaning Harvard or Yale clubs.] Inventive comedy! I was deeply disappointed the author did not write anymore (although he did write under another name about the same topic.) Haight-Ashbury makes an appearance or two as well, and it's after being slammed on the head with logical arguments for many pages that you start to adore the author. His voice shines through the whole work, and I am in LOVE with Herculus Molloy for following his dreams and writing this exceptional piece of words. Highly, highly highly recommended!
Not terrible by any means, just nothing special. I don't know why I picked it up, it cost me about a dollar. Stopped reading after about a third when I realized the pace was only slackening, while the decors were stale, mate. This the problem of reading to much literary fiction, your taste is irrevocably more impeccable and most books lack that special flavour. Anyway, I didn't mind giving it try, you never know how good a book is going to be. If you still need your fix, read "Turned On: the Friede-Crenshaw Case" by Dick Schaap.
A wonderful book that introduced me to many different world views from mainly Chinese, Indian and Japanese schools of thought. In light of quantum mechanics, some of the ideas posited by "Eastern" philosophies are much easier to digest than say, the Judeo-Christian view. As a student of modern physics I felt refreshened and enriched, and helped me get through the quantum mechanics class. Unfortunately near the end the author lets the reins of scrutiny slip with the whole 'bootstrap' philosophy, and therefor the book is not a timeless classic. It kind of reminded me of the 'timewave' by Terrence McKenna in "True Hallucinations", where the author also got carried away a bit much.
Note: this gets bumped up from 3 to 4 stars for its "exotic" setting: Cambodia. I visited that country as young teenager in 2008. Judging from the descriptions of this novel, I wonder whether my parents really did enough research regarding outbreaks of violence. Show, don't tell. That's what my creative writing teachers hammered into my head. Not often am I bothered by telling instead of showing, but in this novel, the characters all possess some magical charisma that is almost never expressed in quirky dialog or inventive actions. All the women (all large breasted) like Asher, the protagonist, but you don't really find out what's so special about him. From what you gather about him, he's a burned-out drug addict hanging out in Phnom Penh, driving around on his cool motorcycle. I was very disappointed with the ending. Julie, Asher's ex-girlfriend, even asks "what the hippie scene is like down at the beach". But no, there's a bombing and kidnapping instead, but I stopped caring. How pleasant would the beach have been, with them just hanging out and finally talking to each other. I guess that's the problem I have with this book. There is not enough genuine talk, either internally or between characters. It's clearly inspired by Dog Soldiers: A National Book Award Winner, in which a heroin package is also shipped to the U.S. from Southeast Asia, but in that favorite book of mine there is a very healthy dose of Zen, bygone hippie utopia and existentialism that is completely lacking here.
With some excisions, this book could have been a resounding novel. As it stands, the pages drag you on, ad boredeum, until you have no will left to continue the expedtion. New characters are introduced, who never add anything meaningful to the narrative. As the epilogue bogs down, the seemingly omniscient narrator purposely jumps through time to establish an irrelevant cliffhanger (Judd), with no importance whatsoever, in the most gimmicky fashion. There were moments of glory, however. For many pages I thought my hands held a solid 5 star book. Perhaps my reading too was suffering ups and downs. The first 150 pages or so were golden, with an exquisite love story and concise depiction of Australia around 1850. From there until about p. 330, one star gradually got lost to the wind. And then I wrote : [will insert last image when imgur allows me to post publicly - by the way, I'm getting tons of hate on that website for not explaining the images!]So you can imagine how torturous the last 100 pages were.
What a ride! I was glad to discover this second book by Pynchon is quite a bit thinner than " V ", which was so big I could not be bothered to keep annotations handy. This time I did that, and it really made the reading experience a lot better. I used these: https://cl49.pynchonwiki.com/wiki/ind...Anyways, let's talk about the book. Phantasmagoria, what-is-going-on, very dense stuff. No doubt many would hate it. I hated Vineland, but I loved this. Imagining a secret dimension is much more interesting than walking around in one. Somehow I never thought the book lost (too much) touch with reality and probability. It was a kind of sweet spot with A LOT of tasty vegan yummy psychedelic goodness... In Pynchon's world, society is an utter wasteland from which one is easily isolated. That's exactly how I feel about the world. I wish there were more flophouses in CL49. I'm also definitely gonna read Gravity's Rainbow someday. But Vineland I won't give another chance. I'm gonna read up on a bunch of analyses too, glad the book is popular enough for people to research it :) I like to pretend that anyone counterculture in the 60s only acted the way they did because they read this wonderful little novel.
I was reading "At Play in the Fields of the Lord" by Peter Matthiessen in a cozy cafe in Amsterdam's Jordaan neighborhood, when a couple seated next to me at the bar struck a conversation with me about - what else? - books! Long story short I asked for their goodreads plus a recommendation based on the book I was reading (see my review about that for even more context). They knew the author, but not the contents of "At Play". I am a huge action cowboy junkie (so long as there's introspective existentialism etc. aplenty), so with the title of this book I was expecting almost something set in a warzone. Reading this book feels amazing because it's so easy to relate to the sensible, reasonable people that populate it. I feel like I could have been one of them, always busying myself with what's right. Especially these days since I'm in the middle of moving places; a picnic seems like a piece of cake compared to installing floors, painting walls, hanging lamps and determining optimal positioning of furniture. The thing I remember most starkly is the idea that people love (sincere) compliments about your work and will want to hang around because of it. Unconsciously I have been opening my Gates of Compliments a little wider since I read that passage. I am thankful for allowing myself to go out in the world and exposing myself to the sun and the cold, warm hearts and cold shoulders, and great book recommendations.
I had no idea what to expect. Around 1970, you can pretty much expect everything, which is great! Stanley Sweetheart is your typical lethargic guy who just doesn't know what to do with his life and prefers not to think about it ever. He's a sophomore (or higher?) student at Columbia in NYC, and there's some nice street scenes of him walking around. Sex is one thing he found out about in high school, and that's pretty much all he ever thinks is worthwhile. Although he's not smooth with the ladies and overthinks every situation, in the opening scene, a Russian language lab, he manages to hook in a young freshwoman, Cathy, he finds attractive. They build up to a sort of relationship, but he treats her like trash and only wants to get her into bed. One thing that stuck out here was that he has no other friends whatsoever, and no mention of previous attempts at connection with a coed. This makes Stanley seem a bit shallow (from the reader/writer perspective), since there are no clues to help imagine what he was doing. He was going to class, but with such little heart in it that even that's hard to believe. Sounds like a pretty terrible book, right? But since the text stays with Stanley in every scene (and you keep on reading), little by little you start to feel for him (a little). He's not completely stupid, he knows his classics and his philosophers, and he even gets some creative projects going in the form of film scripts, most of which are not terrible and somewhat original. But those surface punctures are few, and in the second half wholly absent. I found myself caring less and less about him, and was glad the book was over in the end.
A wonderful story with many hallucinations in the South-American rainforest. McKenna is gifted with the pen and shuts out the boredom that can arise in a metaphysical journey. Up until his final proposition of the "timewave", he manages to shed rational, critical light on all the wacky ideas that are proposed. This makes for a pleasant reading process; the movie "Altered States" similarly keeps the legend buoyed with scientific mumbo jumbo. Then the "timewave" sweeps McKenna away along with his hallusions. An unfortunate end to an awesome book. Still, I much enjoyed it so I will give it 5 stars regardless.
** spoiler alert ** Boy, that was a strange and wacky book. Not in a bad way though. It reminded me a bit of "V." by Thomas Pynchon, with overt innuendos aplenty and less brilliant. The nightclerk vibes in the hotel got me going, and I was reading with 5 stars eyes until the prostitution bit becomes the main focus for sooo long! The anecdotes were positively kooky and wacky etc, there just wasn't enough of a main thread to return to. And I wish there were more description of Frisco at night. I'll have to check if the author wrote anything else, because I did enjoy the writing style a lot. Paragraphs transition seamlessly with clever play of words, and there's a wealth of advertisements, newspapers articles and other snippets that lend the book layers of depth. Almost as if you're reading a really really good comic in literature form.P.S. The author's last name is so appropriate for the book!
** spoiler alert ** I just watched the movie "Lions Love (... and Lies)" by Agnes Varda today. I can't help but imagine Lu Anne from this book was at some point quite like the actress in that one. ±_± Naturally, I'll have to spoil some elements of the novel. ±_±Never would I have imagined I'd have enjoyed so thoroughly a novel taking place almost entirely on a movie set. Stone is an expert at setting unsettling tones and portraying moderately to severely deranged characters. There was some streams psychological instability that reminded me of "Aquarius Obscured" (my favorite short story by the same author).Unfortunately, the last 1/5th of the book strays from the golden path and does not find its way back. P.S. I love the cover art of this first edition, as well as the typeset. And the paper is of amazing quality. Why are modern books so cheap-feeling and ugly?
DNFAfter about a hundred pages in this second part, the only interesting part was the second meta-self-review, which described my thoughts exactly: dull, convoluted, not funny etc. The humorous passages and intelligent observations that kept me going throughout the first part had all but disappeared. Books like these can sustain their momentum only for as long as they keep the reader smiling and thinking. Introducing a new boring character was not the way to go. Perhaps I'll pick it up again in a few years, when I need to empty my mind.
** spoiler alert ** This is one of my favorite bookcovers of, well.. ever! What a brilliant idea, to have these trumpets of praise as an introduction, and one by Thomas Pynchon no less! On the flipside, I knew I was in for a kooky slipstream of postmodernist writing. Kind of like the French Nouvelle Vague movies. It took about a 100 pages to make sense of the haze and confusion in my hands. Finally it started to dawn on me the characters were discussing previously read-about events, making me feel as though my friends were discussing this one night I was zonked to near-oblivion and could only ever so vaguely pull the happen[ed]ings (my neologism) back to the workshop of my mind. This is how you get pulled in, you have to stick with the guys for a while, see if you can keep up. Get a Mutual Understanding. Learn to be a Cool Guy. Up for anything. He keeps racing by, you jump in his vehicle and let him take you on this psychedelic odyssey through college, questioning society, life et al. But that's only for the getting-pulled-in part, because soon enough you realize there's no understanding, there's just this letting go of trying, just experiencing life and slipping into heaven (dates with cool ladies) that don't play games. Luckily for me, there's some great astronomy studying sprinkled 'tween the pages. You see, I'm taking this course on Cosmology starting in September, and boy does that stuff get you thinking about It All. Also, I wish I head read this earlier. I'm getting old, BOY! Although thankfully I'm still a student, I know my youth is slowly running out. When I was 18, I was still marveling at such misogynistic college interpretations as "Revenge of the Nerds" and was rooting for the jocks in fact, 'cause the pretty girls loved to hang out at their mansion. But wait-a-minute, comparably horrific acts are committed here. Paps, the protagonist, cuts off the tip of a condom to surreptitiously impregnate his girl-friend. Why does he do this? I don't want to spoil the book, because the circumstances are, well.. peCUliar. As the above image shows, other characters do not condone this behavior. Instead of all-out comedy, this heinous act is part of a larger disintegration of the main character, who just doesn't know what he's doing, horsing around until his life starts falling apart. When the army finally comes to take him away, he even appears glad to obtain some sense of direction in life. Ultimately, it was a joy to ride with Gnossos - a young wanderer, a rebel, a seeker.
Very well written, the English language never obstructs immersion in early 20th century Ukraine. It almost reads like an autobiography. A page-turner, not a masterpiece. Great to read on a short holiday.
I have a soft spot for the helplessness of junkies in the steamy underbelly of a metropolis, at once exceedingly modern and rotten. At the same time, life is given undeniable purpose with the cycle of getting high again and getting more stuff. No need to figure out anything else. Or the kicking of the habit becomes the primary focus of life. Great NYC junky adventures in the first third, while the chapters in Kentucky, Texas and Mexico are less intriguing. And unfortunately no descriptions of blissful paradise like in the great novel Dog Soldiers. A quick read, a real page turner with ultimately too little to offer to warrant full score.
I just finished The naked lunch., which sent my head spinning. With My Self and I came pleasantly structured non-fiction. Every chapter describes the author's experience in LSD therapy (it was still legal around 1960, so there aren't any unbecoming associations with those 3 letters yet). It's a slow burner though. The first 100 pages or so don't seem to go anywhere. Then the Self and I of the narrator gradually unwind, dragging you in. It's a fascinating story on how therapy can help people embrace themselves, through the prodding of the unconscious mind.Best read unspoiled.
Fantastic book! I read the whole thing in less than 3 days. Hunter keeps every page interesting by interjecting tons of anecdotes in chapters that would be boring without them. Somehow he manages to bridge from one topic to the next; violence, retaliation, loneliness, brotherhood, drugs, politics, homosexuality, fame, money, chickenshitness, provocations. A definitive image of the almost-original Hell's Angels. Are they unsympathetic sons-of-bitches? Hell yes. Anarcho-fascists without much intelligence? Definitely. Interesting... By the end of the book you know everything you will ever need or want to know about the Angels, but what a ride it was. There is something about the pathetic, though active nature of them operating as an organization that is somehow fascinating to me, especially before the major fame hit them. Let it be known that I did not seek out this book because of the Angels, but because I loved what the author had done with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. This is a very different fish, but no less enjoyable. So far I have read two pieces of Thompson's bibliography, and will gladly add more to that :-)
Ah yes, this book wins the National Book Award for fiction (together with Dog Solders - a masterpiece) and still it is under-appreciated. Why do some books stay on top of the list and others don't? I dunno. What I do know this is a wonderfully written novel, tenderly, soft, delicate and smooth, and I'm not a writer but take it from me this is a must-read.
Only enjoyable if you're under 18. This is not more than a YA novel where scary things happen. Although the writing is excellent, painting a bleak picture, repetition follows repetition until suddenly a DEUS appears at the end and all is well.
great book to get a grasp on EU
[minor spoilers of setting]I picked this up because Ken Kesey seems like an ok guy and this was billed as his masterpiece, a novel done "in the new conciousness". . . And I read about it in "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" by Tom Wolfe, where he describes how Kesey would hang out in the bars of logger towns and really get to know the vernacular, then return to his hideaway in La Honda and write "Sometimes a Great Notion" on all kinds of psychedelics. The perspectives shift seamlessly and sometimes rapidly, aligning strips of subjective reality for a mesmerizing crescendo of epic proportions. It took me about 100 pages to get used to this style of writing, and I still crave more. Plotlines build up over most of the book and always manage to deliver favorably. Perhaps I've reached a comportment in life where I don't mind taking forever to finish a book, because this was very long and very dense. And I loved it! If you're reading enjoyably every day, who cares if you finish a book within (1-2-3) weeks?
I've read most of Stone's early bibliography - A Hall of Mirrors, Dog Soldiers (one of my favorite books), Child of Light, the short stories and now this one. I enjoyed the breezy meanderings through Tecan, but there were just a little too many characters and too little pages to make a significant impact. I thought the characters weren't fleshed out quite enough for that.The most compelling is Holliwell's thread. He's the archetypical Stone protagonist; drinking too much, caring too little, aimlessly getting into trouble. The cold war menace emanates through the US-affiliated groups he brushes against, while the communist rebels are given too little time to present a thoroughly iconic image. The other two main characters, Pablo and Sister Justin, are depicted too crudely for my taste and bog the story down. One of the short stories Stone wrote was about Catholics murdering children; with Justin's thread I tasted the same dreariness with Father Egan and the child murdering Mennonite. Pablo starts off well on a constant speed trip, but the moment he gets on the smuggling ship, the Cloud, his thread drops off quickly. The three plot lines inevitable converge, albeit contrived and ultimately unsatisfactorily. Overall I am a little disappointed because the ingredients were there to construct a 5 star story like Dog Soldiers.
Read this a few years back, hasn't stayed with me much. Although the torture near the end is wonderfully Dickensian!
[spoilers] About halfway through the book, I stopped myself and thought: "This Wolfe guy doesn't compare to H. Thompson because he's not a character in the book himself." Only to realize near the end that it was all one giant contextual painting of the warehouse scene offered in the beginning. Then it went straight on full-throttle bayooka-zing-zing through the last days of the Merry Pranksters, who ended up less than merry. It's a very large book, contrary to my expectations. My version had about 350 large, dense pages so it took me more than the usual week to finish it, especially with Wolfe's zappy, cranky writing-style. I'm a sucker for psychedelic hippies, so it was a breeze for me. I took special note of the story as a backdrop to one of my favorite books, "Dog Soldiers" by Robert Stone, who also figures in the EKAAT. Paranoia reigns and drugs abound in Kesey and Stone's stratosphere. By all means, read that book, it's a great novelized, retrospective aftermath of the stuff found here. Also, Hunter Thompson's awesome "Hell's Angels" is a masterful companion piece, for obvious reasons. Back to the Acid Tests -- of which you can find recordings on the Youtube -- of the Merry Pranksters. What were they trying to achieve, exactly? Was it analogous to Timothy Leary's "Turn on, tune in, drop out" ? Transcendence and good vibrations, an overstretched dream. Have you had the 'experience'? Reading this book is likely not the same without, although I can't really judge since I've been ON the bus since reading it. I'm not even talking about taking LSD, just stepping beside of society's games and ladders. Although you could take LSD, why not?
Having decided "Dog Soldiers" is one of favourite books of all time, I had to get this when I found out it existed. My high expectations stemmed from the wonderfulness of that book, which I realised had to be inspired by the stuff of this memoir. I think it's very boring in a lot places. Robert doesn't seem to remember all that much about the sixties, and he keeps ending up on sort of the mainline, impersonal narrative of the time. If you're already familiar with that, he really doesn't offer many interesting anecdotes or insights, unfortunately. He comes across as holding back a lot, for whatever reasons. Maybe he didn't know what he was going to write about? I'm reminded somewhat of Steven Prince, the centrepiece of Scorsese's film "American Boy", who brilliantly reminisces about his drug-fueled adventures. Decades later, fans of this film sought him out and tried to recapture the brilliance of those anecdotes. Steven is older, wiser, but also much more boring, probably because he didn't take all those drugs anymore. I'm getting the same feeling from Stone in this memoir. I think Stone simply forgot all the amazing stuff he experienced and was left with only the more general public's memory, to which he keeps tying in. I was hoping for at least some original material from those times, especially since he quotes other authors' works liberally. Unfortunately it wasn't meant to be. I'm still interested in the Robert Stone of the 60s and 70s, and will try to seek out his articles written for INK and the Guardian. Also a book I found called "Conversations with Robert Stone" seems worth checking out. There are some interesting paragraphs and chapters, but those are overshadowed by the general boredom. It's hard to imagine the person that wrote this, also wrote "Dog Soldiers", a perfect book.In the end, my takeaway is that Stone's style of writing is much too detached from his personal past self to make for an enjoyable read. There is almost no emotion, motivation ascribed to anything that he does.
My English teacher (in Amsterdam) allowed me to read and report on this in high school for a grade. Naturally I didn't read the whole thing, just the first few chapters. I remember the online sex chat rooms, his wife having cancer and something about Paul McCartney? I'm very blank on this book.A good test for something like this is: Would it be worth to read if it was not written by this famous person?
I need to get this one off my book chest. The movie adaptation is a monolith of psychedelic cinema (alongside such greatnesses as "Rainbow Bridge", "Captain Milkshake", "Easy Rider" and "Altered States"), with gorgeous soundscapes by the one and only Joseph Byrd. I knew the filmmakers had added their own flavor to the story, but this book falls incredibly flat. It supplies zero literary value, but somehow hitting a perfect Switzerland-fantasy-inducing note for all kinds of people abroad. In this case, the author being a diplomat added only to the allure, but not to the quality of the work.
Grimy New York City streets filled with junkies, dealers, bail bondsmen, crooked lawyers and corrupt cops. This true, non-fiction story recounts the days of Bob Leuci in the late 60s - early 70s as a special investigator of narcotics. Serpico was good, but was not in the same life-threatening situations as Leuci. Fascinating stuff, and highly recommended to anyone.
I have to admit right away that the Pynchon recommendation kept me going. I absolutely love 'V' and 'The Crying of Lot 49' (didn't like 'Vineland', and 'Mason & Dixon' remains to be read after I dropped out.) I probably would have given a star less if it weren't for that blurb. Having said that, this book is a little excruciating to read. An alternative title could have been "Dazed and Confused". Unreliable narrators rarely, if ever, deliver for me. It seems as though the narration takes place after the facts, but not too long after. Whatever. It started off so well with the reminiscences of Nog and his way of life. There were some decent living-in-a-commune scenes and you get used to the uncertainty, but this just wasn't for me. Maybe if you liked "In Watermelon Sugar" a lot, you'd enjoy this. I guess I am addicted to structure, and if post-modernism isn't funny, then what is it? I would recommend it only to Pynchon completionists.
Just a collection of hard-core pornography short stories. I think there was a time that books with sex and a little bit of redeeming literary quality were praised to smithereens.
Started off with some interesting observations, then completely lost itself in a boring and unnecessary plot without any style. There's not any dealing done whatsoever in the book, just a dreadfully tedious plot with bad observations. 4 stars for the first 1/3, and 2 stars for the last 2/3s. Would not recommend to anyone.
There are so many different approaches to life explored here, there's bound to be some you'll like. However, Gustaitis is not a gifted writer. I skipped many chapters and passages. The author would apparently pen all collected notes, forgetting to scrutinize them. So many details mentioned are simply irrelevant. More an odd artifact from its time than a joy to read. I especially liked the Morningstar Ranch chapter, it felt almost fleshed-out Gonzo. Read in 2022 in Amsterdam. Had to put it down for some time due to boredom. I found it because I was hungry for more turnons after Dick Schaap's brilliant non-fic Turned On about the fate of two NYC junkies around 1966.
My expectations were toooooo high, I suppose. I wanted to read something from Cleaver before continuing on with "My Psychedelic Love Story", by Tim Leary's widow, Joanna Harcourt-Smith. Why is so much of the book so incredibly boring? Cleaver's literary capacities do not warrant long essays on why women are so desirable, or the letters to his lawyer. It started of so well with his prison schedule and brief discussions on his past crimes, but I gradually lost so much interest I put the book down about 3/4 through. Nice font goodreads uses btw, especially on that three fourths. And don't get me wrong, I don't give low ratings because the writer is a sociopathic rapist en murderer; I judge the book without judging the author. Ultimately, I think Cleaver's life only got really interesting after he left prison. This book is not ruthless enough for me.
The magnificent tv shows "The Wire" and "Homicide: Life on the Streets" left me wanting for more. I know there's also the TV show "The Corner" -- wait David Simon also wrote a book on that, called "The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood"?? Oh man, I need to get that as well. Anyway, I knew the show was based on a non-fiction book, and I had to read it. The show remains one of my top 10 shows of all time (only first 3 seasons). About the book: many of the little stories I was already familiar with through the show -- can I stop talking about TV for one sentence? This is Goodreads! I'm sorry, having loved the show so much I can't help but view this book solely through a TV lens. Final try: gritty late '80s Baltimore homicide non-fiction come-along with many interesting police characters. Very few action-packed criminal pursuits. Beautiful portrayal of a black-majority city riddled with crime. Replete with clever observations on racism, (office) politics, ghetto life, and so on. If you like true-crime, you'll love this.
One of the few books I've been able to get my father to read. Very intriguing imagery of love and death. I read this during my WWI phase.
I was probably too young when I read it, about 18-19. I found it difficult to get through, but the charisma of the King was excellently portrayed. Maybe I'll read it again someday.
What a great cover! And what a shame the insides couldn't live up to the outsides. The protagonist, while philosophically minded, has embraced some sort of drunken nihilism, cutting her off from the reader's care and interest entirely. She remains unfazed by most of the uncomfortable situations she throws herself in, except for a few rare occasions when she decides to flee, only to realize she has no plans whatsoever. There's a strong theme somewhere about the crushing Californian straight life, but it gets lost in the pointless movie making, scattered by the frequent purposeless memories called forth. I wouldn't go so far as to call the protagonist implausible, but there is simply not enough of value to hang on to. By the time the character explains herself, illustrating the pointlessness of life without success, this story itself has become pointless. The contrasting of insanity against putative sanity is an interesting idea, but the execution falls flat. I just might pick up the author's other novel. For your enjoyment, read this wonderful essay by N. Young: https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a... 29/01/23It seems ages ago that I read this. But I totally forgot to mention there's a passage in this book describing the main character picking up a novel that enthralled her in less distressing times: ``I turned on another light and opened boxes until I found one that contained The Confidence-Man. Sitting down, I began to read it again. Pausing at the finger-smudged section on the metaphysics of Indian hating, my eyes ran down lines that I had long ago underlined, but no longer knew quite why. At the back of the book there was a list of characters in one column, then an equals sign followed by a blank. It was headed: ``The Balance." This book brought that book to my attention in this way, and I am very glad for it. Now that I typed out the above passage with the Confidence-Man in mind, I understand more deeply the main character's fleeting notion of identity. Yet even more engrossing is the notion that the main character was much more enthralling in earlier times, when she still read books and didn't drink herself to death at every opportunity. I wish the author had considered that, because the talent and content is all buried beneath the madness here.
Every time I shave with my 'dull' razor blade, I'm reminded of this book, where you buy them on the black market apparently? This is one of my problems with the world-building of the book; the state seems to be all-encompassing but somehow you need buy razor blades illegally, even though half the population is an intelligence agent. Rats frighten me most of all animals, so the rat-in-a-glass-on-your-belly hit home for me. I can see why people like it but there really is not such a state in the Western world. A good novel, not a great one (I'm picky). The best dystopia I've read, much better than that other one where they use a bunch of xtc the whole time, Brave New World.edit: I see that Pynchon has written the foreword, never knew that. I'll give it a read.
A masterpiece. I love that feeling when there's 4-5 levels of depth in a book, and somehow I cannot reach the final level. The book is smarter than me. It reads like a classic novel, with very clearly structured episodes and recurring characters. I recommend keeping an analysis handy to understand it more completely. I read this alongside Native Son, a lesser but very readable piece.
Although enjoyable at times, there were too many over-the-top aspects like the mountains of trash in the apartment. I can dig the vibe, but it was a tad overblown to my liking. I plowed through it during short (and some long) bursts on the circular hole, a location I deemed appropriate for the content.
First of all, this book absolutely left me wanting to read something else by this author. What a complete balls-out guy he must have been. Just a glance at his biography will reveal he's been present at numerous volatile moments in history. After all, he was a war correspondent. This reminded me a bit of Paul Bowles and Albert Camus. I think I've got a knack for post-WWII novels set in colonial spaces. There's something about the futility (especially in retrospect) of the whole situation in places like French Indochina, French North Africa etc., in combination with the sense of there having been very unique societies, that makes for an awesome backdrop to a story. Somehow such a setting seems more disconnected from the present to me than much older settings, although there's tons of traces left of course. Okay, now to the book itself: [spoilers] Think Cold War, the tail end of (European) colonialism, dystopian feeling abound. The main attraction is the subtle, underlying prescience of American interventionism around the corner. And a great development of character. I did not care too much for the non-chronological set up of the book, that was a small oversight I think. But on other levels - character development - it works quite well. It's a novella more than a novel, so you can probably finish it in a day or two. I'll be looking out for another of Graham Greene's works.
It reads almost like a script for the movie, and very page-turnery at that. It's classic pulp, but I expected more from the source material of such a great movie. It's bordering on a YA novel with some violence involved. For some reason, I didn't find the characters very believable and the way they were positioned in the world, it's almost a fantasy. Maybe that's the point? Either way, it's nice to read on holiday if you just want a page turner.
Such a beautiful book. I read it a few years ago and still remember it fondly, except maybe the last page, that was a little bummer but that's how people are sometimes I guess.. Anyway, since I loved it so much and still think of it sometimes, it gets a place on my GOLDEN bookshelf; the highest honor books can get. Congratulations, "The Age of Innocence", you are one of the lucky, though deserving, few!
One of my top 10 books. I've always had an appetite for the counterculture era, and this one deals with it the best. Hallucination in book form.
Years ago, while reading Franny, I found myself crying on the toilet seat just like her. Something about that little tale was deeply poignant to me. During those days, terrible ruts punctuated my happy life. Quite simply I had not cried enough for all my woe (I still haven't). I broke down after my mom inadvertently interrupted an unannounced yet desperately needed meditation session, just like Franny did. I tried reading on with ``Zooey", but in a way I responded just like Franny would have: break off, don't listen, return to my own comfortable sad space (note: I presumed the two stories were unrelated). Zooey takes his time to work his way up to Franny, which I didn't even get to on my three attempted (and rebooted) readings. All through the first half of the story or so, I was Franny crying out in the living room. Far from the concise brilliance of ``Franny'', ``Zooey'' gradually gains momentum in order to delicately unwind the cowering emotional entanglements. In this masterfully crafted piece, Zooey fires all his cannons at Franny, relentlessly attempting unsuspected avenues across her lines of emotional defence. And when she does take her face out of the couch, something magical has happened. At the zenith of my reading and writing capabilities, I have finally read one of the most beloved stories of my beloved. And I realized, I have been transforming into Seymour.
Well, I went way out of my way to find this book. When you dive into obscurity, it's usually a hit or miss. This book was heralded as an LSD story somewhere. Unfortunately, it's extremely flat and shallow, besides just being a reiteration of Timothy Leary as the Acid Prophet. It's not original and not engaging.
** spoiler alert ** This book started off so well, I remember thinking 'finally I've got another 5* in my hands'. There was a brutal sense of down and out Americans that I imagined closed the gap between Paul Bowles and Robert Stone. Feverish drunkards in the jungle, the natives' religious tendencies, missionaries at the edge of Christianity; the author seemed to know his facts. Nevertheless, some glaring pacing issues started to break up the experience starting halfway through the book. One event was described successively from three different perspectives, each contained in a separate chapter. Thus chronology was lost in the muddy jungle waters, along with a star in my review. The farther I got in the book, the more haphazard personality changes and motives appeared. Unfortunately I finished the book this morning caring much less about it than I started with.
Never wrote a review for this. Not very memorable, just one day with some standard action (military violence). Perhaps good for its time (1967) but not worth picking up. Go for Sand in the Wind
Read this a long time ago, when I was around 12. My mom gave it to me. Nothing really made sense, this boy went around and it was a big borefest.
After a very strong and funny start - I laughed plenty of times, and I don't laugh easily - some episodes in the book drag on and on without being interesting at all. And the main plot, which all is supposed to lead up to, falls very flat. It's a shame because I was getting strong "The Wire" tickling at the beginning. Not everyone can be interesting, I get that. Still, it could have used some editing and scrapping.
How did I end up reading this? Well, I was reading Robert Stone's A Hall of Mirrors (his second novel Dog Soldiers is one of my favorite books of all time) and there is mentioned the island of Fernando Poo, which, as a citizen of the world well-acquainted with topography, I had not heard of before. A little searching will bring you to its current name, Bioko, much more fitting to its West-African situation. Anyway, on the wikipedia page this trilogy of books was mentioned. And on some hackers' website it was considered the left-(or was it right?) brain half opposite of Douglas Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.About the book: not easy to put down, it's quite a joy to keep reading on. Honestly I don't dig science fiction, most of postmodernism, conspiracy (although Pynchon's V. I consider a masterpiece - how the hell didn't they refer to that book more? The V. is so obviously part of the Law of Fives they keep insisting on!), anything with nonlinear time travel structure, but there are plenty of engaging observations that keep the text fresh and intriguing. I won't be reading this part again, but I am eager to go on to the second and third parts. There's also many physics-related comments I would have not grasped if I didn't study that. Ultimately, while the shifting of scenes from paragraph to paragraph works reasonably well, they are not always sewn together as exquisitely as Ken Kesey managed in Sometimes a Great Notion. Overall the book doesn't resonate with me in the way V. did with it's mysterical allusions, but it's still a fine effort.
This was billed as "Terry Southern's masterpiece". That does make me doubt the value of his other work. There's plenty of satire on "everything is for sale if the bid is high enough", but every kid above 12 years old already figured that one out. Instead of cohesive plot, the book presents barely connected short chapters with Guy Grand's tomfoolery of spending money to cause mayhem (paying stage actors to mess up on purpose, putting paper money in a large bathtub full of faeces; honestly I don't even remember most of these episodes clearly, since they were not particularly creative, funny or interesting. Sure, I giggled a few times, especially during the eponymous chapter, where a luxury cruise for those who can afford goes awry, but I didn't read any real depth. A perfect read when you are very tired and don't have the energy for high literature.Perhaps a pointed subtitle would be: The Magic ChristianFor shits and giggles
"Every thought or hint of a thought took on a personality stronger than his own." A nightmare novel of drug addiction and seething nihilism. Patrick took me down with him, somewhere in a seedy part of NYC. There's voices in his head, and he doesn't know what to with his life. A large inheritance has warded off death, but not decay. He's to pick up the ashes of his father, who he never got along with nor admired. To kill time, and to keep the voices at bay, he stoops to injecting himself with temporary-relief solvents. Old habits are unleashed (even though he's only 22). He gradually declines physically and mentally for lack of care, sleep, food, etc, and meets up with various friends and acquaintances along the way, before returning back to the U.K. The writing is visceral. Through an assortment of memories, observations and fantasies,whirling quagmire of Patrick's inner being pulls you in. I wanted him to feel better, to get out of this terrible rut he was in, for whatever reason it was. Ultimately, not much is changing, so I felt a bit cold when finishing, especially after the extended seemingly random last chapter. Maybe this book would have benefited from a larger story (which I know there is, I should perhaps keep on reading with the next part but I feel justified in judging this book on its own).
Memory of this book is also at an airport, this time in Bali Denpasar. I had to open my backpack for a random search on arrival. I had this book with me and a standard plastic bag with B12 vitamin pills. I was much more afraid of the search people realizing this book was banned than I was with the pills (they took one and tested it). I can see why the book was banned in certain countries, but it's the polar opposite of a blunt provocation. Magical realism is usually not my thing, but this bad boy (which it is) tickled me right. An allegory is great when the objective is clear, otherwise it's just a pointless dream. Become a bad boy yourself by reading it.
** spoiler alert ** There's so much loving going on in this book. I'm sure I'd have found it overblown with fluff. Now that I have been *in* love for so many years, bathing in this self-replenishing fountain of joy, I can turn off my mind, relax and float down stream. That's from the Beatles' song Tomorrow Never Knows. I relished in the loving conversations between the characters. There's wisdom to be found, and a lot of emotional expressions to latch onto. `Nobody likes being alone that much. I don't go out of my way to make friends, that's all. It just leads to disappointment.' And in that very special way (the Turtles - "You Showed Me") the book is dotted with classic music and novels. Occasionally, "dotted" becomes "littered". I wish the narrator would integrate cultural references more in the story. I suppose the narrator (also the writer of the book in a framed story) aimed to cement the book in the times when Naoke was still alive, and to somehow explain his love for her. But he does not establish in detail what makes her so special. As the tale progresses, I increasingly wondered if the only reason he felt anchored to her was because of their shared mourning over Kikure (sorry - I am terrible at remembering Japanese names correctly). His fondest memory of her is ejaculating in her mouth. They never really talked soul-to-soul for very long. Oh well. `Something inside me had dropped away, and ntothing came in to fill the cavern. There was an abnormal lightness to my body, and sounds had a holow echo to them. I went to classes more faithfully than ever.' Although the rainy scene on the roof of a department store was quite vivid, towards the end the story bogs down a bit. I found the first half of the book much more poignant than the second.
A nice little book with unfiltered interviews of early 60s NYC addicts; unfortunately most of the interviewees aren't the greatest storytellers, but it comes off very authentic and frightening.
** spoiler alert ** An enjoyable read, nothing too fancy. I thought the reader’s perspective was a little too loose at times, alternating between all-knowing and staying with one character in a scene. I was aiming for four stars after just finishing, but as I collect my thoughts now I can’t go higher than 3. For a 5 star version, read “Dog Soldiers” by Robert Stone. [spoiler]I also felt that an interesting scene was missing at the end.. instead of the boring epilogue, why not explain what, if anything, happened between Elias and Emily? Why do writers mess up the latter parts of books so often?edit: I have to say I absolutely loved the way the police report was conveyed in the book. That alone is worth half a star, so maybe I should give it 3.5 stars. I wish the book had continued more in the routine of the police officers. That way the author could've showed off his knowledge of these details.
Mystery done right. Very re-readable. Chandler has a mighty pen.
Another Vietnam novel? Yes, there appears to be an appetite in me for this stuff. Like I wrote in other novels' reviews, like for Sand in the Wind movies like Apocalypse Now and Platoon instilled in me a kind of Platonic concept of this time and place in the jungle with a bunch of Western guys being sent there against their will. That draft, it'll change your life. Thankfully the draft here in the Netherlands is voluntary. You still get a letter at your eighteenth birthday, but you don't have to show up. The pay is pretty good, and there is very little chance of seeing action. Only one review besides me! How did I find this obscure book? I remember I was searching the university library catalogue with the keywords Dog Soldiers [by] Robert Stone, as that was (and is? I think so) my all-time favorite novel and wanted to read stuff like it. Then I came across an academic article discussing several Vietnam novels, one of them this one. So by virtue of association I decided to give it a go. Also the article mentioned that Lieutenant Kit, one of Rising's main characters, was a great character since he embodied some part of America or something, I'll have to look it up someday. Anyway.What makes this book special? What haven't I read before? This book takes place mostly in some command post in Vietnam, populated with generals, lieutenants, lieutenant generals, majors, colonel, etc. That makes for a reading experience different from those showcasing privates, corporals and sergeants. It's pretty interesting for a while. The narrative walks a tightrope between the deadpan folly and incompetence of all involved, and harsh conditions of the very real war conditions. About halfway to three quarters through, the narrative loses balanceand the characters aren't interesting enough, or too egotistical or stupid, to make you root for them at the big final showdown. I always know I can't give a novel four stars when I'm wishing it was over for the last bit. With four stars, the novel is flawed but you still don't want it to end.
What a cool, crazy guy this Herr character. What the f* were they thinking? But yes, it was all one big great adrenaline rush, a brush with death. This book really (if I may judge) tells you 'what it was like'. New Journalism in late 60's Vietnam, here we go! (As I'm writing from my ivory tower in the Western World, where no radical change ever happens.) It's thrilling how the horror and gore gets put to the side, like they embraced those but also recognized how they obstruct a clearer view of the story at hand. I read somewhere that not all of it mayhaps be non-fictional a hunnerd pur-cent, but who cares! If that makes the reading more enjoyable, it embellishes the book at the cost of truthful purity. Why would you not want that? This is "Apocalypse Now" in book form, from the perspective of a friendo of that crazy journalist at the end. My only friend, the end.
After having read Lord of the Rings - yes I enjoyed it very much - I did not expect a child's book. I genuinely expected something more sophisticated. So I don't understand why people love this so much. I think the book could use a ton more world-building, painting the scene etc. The riddles were cool though. Thinking of it as a story that would be told to children in the Shire redeems it somewhat. On its own, it's too shallow.
Decent overview of the history of mathematic(ian)s. Most of the masterminds did not actually lead all that interesting lives. Some repetition dulls the reader somewhat: of course almost every one of these mathematical greats were the best in the rural school at age 13. During my physics course plenty of mathematical methods are named after their inventor, so it was nice to see where Riemann, Gauss, Euler, Poincare, etc. etc. came from. Interestingly, several "men of mathematics" were close to Napoleon Bonaparte, who had some sort of scientific dream and wished to surround him with great thinkers. Favorite chapters: Lobatchewsky (as rural as you can get, early 19th century Kazan, Russian Empire), Hamilton (Ireland lends a welcome flavor from the host of French and German mathematicians), Galois (a countercultural rebel if there ever was one! Died in a duel at very young age), Hermite (physical shortcomings, mystical interpretations to the numbers), Poincare (the last universalist, psychology of mathematical exploration), Cantor (for tackling the fundamentals of maths).
This bit of the kirkusreviews.com review piqued my interest: And one or two scenes seem perilously similar to ones in Robert Stone's fuller, more striking Dog Soldiers. Nonetheless, the mix of malpractice and relentless foulness here is eventually addictive: it's a grim piece of business, as ugly (and linear) as sin--and horrifically compelling once it gets going.Unfortunately, I have to agree with those words. This book doesn't live up to its inspiration. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. Maybe that was the problem, but whenever Dog Soldiers is mentioned, I am brought back to the glorious (re)readings of that perfect novel. What was the point of this adventure? And why was there so much trouble, considering they had done it so many times before. In Dog Soldiers, much of the tension stems from the sheep-against-the-wolves situation. The characters are lethargic, without any interesting background story to make them intriguing. The first few dozen pages are meant to set up the atmosphere, but ultimately falls quite flat and makes the characters quite forgettable. Miami and Key West in the early 80s were painted colourfully, and the narrative style was original (characters reminisce in first person), although they ramble on way too much. A few hundred pages of monologue is hard to pull off. Only two of them get the literary microphone; I think letting some of the others chime in would have benefited the book.
Can't say this did much to me. The book felt way too bland to hold my attention. Supposedly it's exciting, I thought it was quite boring.
Boy, what a great book. An outstanding philosophical and existential novel. I won't spoil the details, but the way a journey and philosophy are weaved together is truly amazing. It was an absolute joy and a breeze to read. Deep, yet accessible, it warms your heart and even proposes some genuinely original philosophical notions to ponder. Wow, just wow. Imagine "True Hallucinations" by McKenna but with a more intelligent concept than the time-wave. One of my favorite books of all time.
Cool cover art.Text is quite readable and intelligent. Story is going nowhere, just a whole lot of build-up and no payoff. Not worth your time, I'd say.
The earth moved... for me when I read this one. It prompted me to read other stuff by this author, but none of it reached the highs of the rolling Iberian hills.Some books are good, this one is great. I'm trying to concoct a message for candidate readers.. why would I recommend it? Top notch literary quality! I think it's extremely difficult not to appreciate the great literary value offered in this book.
Bowles pulled it off again with his third novel. Please beware, I will include spoilers in this review. In some respects, I prefer "The Spider's House" even more than "Let It Come Down" and "The Sheltering Sky". There's profound events happening all over, making the sinister undertones even more poignant and allowing for more surprises. And this time around, the characters delve much deeper with their considerations of the natives. The ubiquitous, malodorous cesspools are not weighted with stern disapproval, and well. . . now I'm just describing the book. What I'm trying to say is that it's yet another fascinating take on colonial French Morocco at its moment of expiration, from completely fresh angles that did not appear in the previous books, that make it yet another flavor of the time and place; naturally drenched in existentialism. Endings of novels I take special note of. "Let It Come Down" fell somewhat short unfortunately, but here is one of the most beautiful endings I've read. Most illuminating of Bowles' novels is the exposure of your Eurocentric sense. "The Sheltering Sky" was a complete eye-opener for me in this regard. At this point I must allow Bowles to take the title of most-consistent writer I've read; all three of his first novels I rate quite highly, and the short stories together only add to the grade average. A brilliant writer, who deserves any criticism outside his literature.
Starts off really well and had me hoping for a 5 star little book, but bogs down in fantastic, formulaic gibberish. Like watching a bad 50s Hollywood movie. Ultimately not worth picking up.
This is a life-affirming and value-evalutating story about a Orange County family torn apart over political allegiances, ways of life and years of emotional neglect. Joe, the dad who comes to terms with his supreme dissatisfaction with life, his only friends other potentates that he doesn't personally appreciate, and who just wants to see his children prosper (without of course really listening to them - poignant father/son scenes abound). Polly, the mom who cheated on him when she found out he voted for Nixon. Richie, the ultimate surfer dude who gets drafted after getting busted with weed in his car. Dave, the Berkeley radical student who gets stretched between his ultra-radical girlfriend and any other, more comfortable life than getting beat up for preaching truth.Sary, the teenage sister that is a bit underwritten, but shows flashes of intelligent perception (like how the poorer neighborhoods of Santa Ana disprove any idealistic view of America).There's a few other interesting characters I won't mention here. There is a big payoff to all the character buildup, making the reading experience like a neat ribbon being tied before your eyes. Although right-wing, property-over-people characters are easy to hate, I found it a learnsome (is that a word?) reading experience. Overall this is a very truthful book. Fathers are not holy priests, fortunately for us!
Good to read, but not special. I came across it from some list of top English novels (maybe TIME?). I read it years ago, hasn't stayed with me. I'm sure it's interesting but this is nobody's favorite book.
Put it down at page 270, because I just didn't care about what happened anymore. The style of writing was getting a little boring. A few weeks later I did complete it, for completeness' sake, but it didn't change my opinion much. I wanted to read it after Dr Thompson's praisal. You can see the influence this has had on his writing. Not too sure about reading another of his recommendations. When the erotic sequences are the most enthralling of the bunch, you know it's a mediocre piece. It wasn't really going anywhere or saying anything, nor being beautiful to read. Hard skip to recommend this to anyone.
Perhaps it introduced some cool goings-on when it was published, but now it reads like a terrible exploitation movie. A wide array of paper thin characters, explaining everything (my intelligence was insulted many times), tedious inconsequential chapters... ugh. My head feels nauseous from plowing through to the end. Everything feels cheap, everything gets repeated over and over and over until you wish the author had someone proof-read this. Don't let the first chapter (which was very good at vividly painting a street scene) pull you in. It's not worth the ride. High unrecommended. Try Howard Street instead.
The first book in a long time that I had to put down. You know, kind of like putting down a doggie. I read until about page 120, until I realized it was going to be just some bogus story. So many times the narrator tells about some boring day of a character that doesn't tie in with anything else, and fails to stand alone as engaging literature, things get dreary quickly. The narrator, Collie, sometimes reminded me Cutter from "Cutter and Bone", another washed-up thirtysomething. Maybe the Hell's Angels were intimidating in their depiction here, but Sir Hunter S. Thompson's book is where the actual party is. Anyway, regarding the story I didn't finish, my best guess is that Denny killed that movie producer guy over what he did to Vickie, end of story. The reactions of several characters at the end - oh yeah, I forgot to mention I skipped chapters 9, 10, 11 to flip through chapters 12 and 13 - also didn't do anything to reignite my interest. If you find yourself looking for a nice, obscure novel, look elsewhere. It reads like a bad Hollywood movie from the late 60s.
Reads like a young YA novel without any literary value, moderately insulting your intelligencr. The awful narration ruins what slim potential the storyline possessed. This odyssey for amazing 60s novels does occasionally turn up unintelligible mutterings like this.
Hahaha the you-est title ever
** spoiler alert ** Another Vietnam war novel? Yes, I'm guilty as charged. Growing up, I watched a lot of war movies. Vietnam was one of the most exotic and interesting settings for some of my favorites like "Apocalypse Now", "Platoon" and "Captain Milkshake". By and large, this was the turning point of American greatness (at least in perception, if not in fact). Moreover, some progressive elements of society were fast gaining size and momentum. The on-screen indulgence in psychoactive substances is a big part of what makes those movies so mesmerizing. And then there's the more military aspect of this war: forced conscription for the boys of the U.S.A., a suffocating jungle, and the last major war that took place without computers and other advanced technology, which makes "humanity" more involved than nowadays. Big portable back-borne radios were the only communication line for patrols. Anyway, my appetite was not yet fulfilled by the great books Dispatches and Dog Soldiers. If anything, they only increased it :) most of the Vietnam books I've read since were quite forgettable (The LBJ Brigade, One Very Hot Day. I probably read another one or two, but don't recall). So, what makes this novel so great? It's quite long, 500 big pages. I read it daily before falling asleep. There was something about showing up each day, and holding on, holding out, just like the soldiers. You never know when a burst of violence will occur. As the days kept passing, more and more of the colorful and cool veterans got replaced by fearful and boring grunts, while the characters we survived with morphed into veterans themselves. And there's about 5 different characters that are 'followed by the camera', some only for a few pages, which keeps things fresh. Then there's the vibrant depiction of Da Nang, which I always wondered about since I heard Ned from South Park say in his nasal voice: "I was stationed in Da Nang." That's also one of the key locations where the soldiers get some time off surviving in the jungle, and have the time and space to think back about some of the things they experienced and witnessed. The only major letdown of the novel is the resolution of the "phantom blooker" plot thread: supposedly, an American G.I. has defected to the Vietnamese with his grenade launcher. Some people say they have seen him, clearly and American, firing grenades in the night. He causes dozens of casualties of months time. Ultimately, they find him somewhere buried in a hill, and one of the regular blookers, Chalice (the protagonist) kills him with the same grenades. This is a huge anticlimax to me, as there is no conversation, no understanding, only killing him and that's it. Not even books of this "phantom blooker" that he read, or a dogtag, just nothing. Too bad, it could have been legendary, because the buildup to this was extravagant.To end this review, I will show you some passages I thought exemplify why this book is a bar above most war novels. These guys actually read interesting books! Such information stays with you in other scenes. Receiving letters from home, a special moment for the guys. Obligatory existential thought. Chalice realizing he's no longer a grunt now. Something I did not know I would like beforehand and that was completely missing from other war novels: accurate and clear descriptions of marching and formations.How the retiring of a comrade can have a big impact. Delirious combat. One higher placed man, a colonel maybe, ponders the turning point I described above.
This little big book paints a large picture of the events, and reads quite breezily. I skipped many passages, especially the endless meandering of Western Allied commanders about the partition of Germany after the war. When you finally get to the part where the title of the book is applicable, about 4/5ths in, many questions that have emerged logically from the text are left completely unanswered, even totally un-asked. For example: why did the German High Command want to burn all their bridges so badly and fight to the end? The author completely neglects any form of speculation, turning this potentially great book into dull historian's work.
I am a victim of the having-watched-the-movie-before-the-book-syndrome. Even my edition of hte book mentions the film on the cover. While the perspective of the chief was very refreshing, I missed the explosive energy of Jack Nicholson. Sorry, I know this isn't fair but they made me watch this movie in high school for English class! Wayyyy before I started reading adult books for pleasure.
What a terrible existence... to grow up on a reservation and becoming so nihilistic because of it. Peyote sounds dope though, but could also worsen the emptiness, I suppose. And then the alcohol.. you need to relax but then sometimes you take too much. Drunk day after day, throwing away any shitty, small chances you have. This book made me have more respect about Native Americans and native Greenlanders (in Denmark, who are notorious for alcoholism and destituteness there). I forgot the name of the native friend of Abel, who let him stay in his little room above that old lady. He was a very, very convincing character with all his descriptions. There were some moments in the book I was not sure if I had the right character in mind, but was glad when the author confirmed my conjecture, like he wouldn't hold my hand too much. That was very pleasant. I thought it was a refreshing perspective, one to add to my collection of ingredients that make up the melting pot called U.S.A.
Tom, a previous commenter, deceived me. You could only bring this book to a lecture as a ghastly bomb of a novel. Not often do I slam down the 1-star. Stay away from this excuse of a book. Written in first person, this book has a narrator who is so extremely pretentious, annoying and I-art-Holier-than-Thou, so convinced of his own brilliance and cool-ness, that I wondered if this was written by Emmett Grogan, who in Ringolevio: A Life Played for Keeps reaches similar levels of pompousness. Regardless, nothing interesting is happening whatsover - this is a total exploitation book, kinda like a lot of those 60s/70s movies are. Avoid at all costs.
A preposterous stream of utterly inconsequential gibberish, populated for the most part with paper thin characters. Only Jacques and the priest succeeded in transmitting intelligible mutterings. If only the content could match the marvellous typesetting.
In true post-modern tradition, form is formlessness and the plot is impossible to disentangle from the mess printed on the pages. Halfway through I realized I was hampered by unmet expectations. I knew the book would take me to extravagant places like Tangiers, New York City, Mexico, and was ready for some amazingly intricate plot to weave all those places together. Instead I was served with this disjointed mess. I really wish I were cooler and could pretend I loved the shit out of "The Naked Lunch", heralded as a masterpiece of drug literature. And as wrong as this sounds, I was not put off by little boy prostitutes, degeneracy of man into animal, whirlpools of nightmare visions sucking you in but not taking you anywhere. This following line resonated deeply with my reading experience:Yet there is the feeling some sacred meaning lies buried beneath the madness. He knows about letting the mind go, about allowing things to happen instead of forcing ideas to arise: It's little treasures like those that restore faith in the author. However, I did not manage to gain much of a foothold in this stupefying mosaic of words. Still, it felt a bit like fasting. Everything I have read since has brought much delight, as if I had been swimming for dear life in a brown, muddy ocean filled with decaying bodies and sex-addicts, with any text feeling as a piece of driftwood no matter how poorly written. For that reason I have tacked on a star.
DNF a few years ago and I won't ever open it again, I realized yesterday.I really wanted to like this novel. Political intrigue in early 19th century Scotland? That sounds amazing! Unfortunately I should have realized that not every 19th century novel would be as amazing as Vanity Fair. This book just reeks of pomposity. It's your typical English gentleman-dude that is a class above other people and has somewhat of a nature-romantic side to him. But the descriptions are way too drawn out, while nothing of note is happening for dozens of pages. My expectations were dead wrong; I thought I had my hands on a great adventure novel, but it was more boring even than anything non-adventurous. Sorry if my negativity hurt you.
Loved it read it really fast and Sunday is definitely my favorite character, although the author could've used they more throughout the book since their pronouns are he/they
the hate u give little infants fucks everybody
deze shit was crazy. i love it
read it on the beach😎 (in kirgizie HAHA)
I loved this book. It is written in a very creative way, the whole book is a letter to either God or to a sister. The love that these sisters have for each other goes beyond the wrath of time or the oppression they experience in their lives. It's beautiful and easy to read. It is a touching tale with a lot of confronting subjects that'll make you think about love and family.
Thank you Marie Lu for the greatest ending this series deserved. I cried my eyes out. You thouched me with these books and legend will always have a special place in my readers heart.
I loved the switch from story of romance to story of adrenalin! I just couldnt put the book down, again. I has a grip on the reader and it will not loosen. On to the last book.
This book made me feel again what I feel when you just loose yourself in a world. This book reminded me of the reason I love to read: get lost in a story. You just cant put divergent down. The story is so well written and so fast paced, you feel connected with Tris and Four. Every chapter is a delight to read. Now on to the next book. Well done veronica roth.
It was a enjoyable story but not very believeble. It's a series but I only found that out at the abrupt ending. I'm not going to read the rest though.
For me there were 2 parts in this book.The first part is about a really obnoxious teenage boy who just seems self absorbed. He doesn't care about his friends, not really. And when his puppylove disappears he gets obsessed. Like really obsessed. Then there is a middle part where John just rolls out teenage problems and feelings which was pleasant to read through.The second part is the roadtrip. This was where for me the story really took off. It was a laugh-out-loud kinda read. The ending was the only ending that would have worked for the whole. I liked the book, I like laughing out loud when reading a book, and I liked Bas peeing in bottles after holding it for hours and Radar wearing a racist shirt.
I was really anticipating this last piece of the puzzle. And when I put it down a few hours ago I was just stunned by the way it ended. The last few pages would have required a whole book to make it a good story line. Now it was rushed, with all the aspects of a YA book in the last 100 pages. The whole GP GD thing was superficial and should have either become the main plot or stayed a side plot. Now the story just derailed. The unnecessary death was just that, unnecessary and felt just for the sake of a typical YA ending that lacked depth. Roth had written herself in a corner in Insurgent with so many questions left unanswered, but answered them only partially in Allegiant. I missed the strong Tobias we have learned to love and I was disappointed with Roth's choice to write through him, because describing someone is not the same as writing though someone, she showed us that. I missed the whole point of being Divergent, it was just a question lazily answered and than left alone. I would have liked to see more of Christina she could have become so much more interesting if the story would not just revolve around Tris en Tobias bickering the whole book.The last disappointment came when the Evelyn proved herself right. In insurgent she told Tris that she was temperate and Evelyn would be forever.I liked reading this book, but I suggest anyone who wants to read it to take this ending as a option rather than a fact. Let the series end in your imagination rather than end rushed. The story deserves better than the ending it got.
The reason this book is so thick is a good one. All the story lines are worked out nicely. The down sides of this book were the remarks pilgrim made sometimes to let you know as a reader what was going to happen ( like I should have known better or that was a mistake) once or twice cab make it interesting more is just spoiling the story as you read it. What also really anoyed me was the typical American view. America was good rest of the world not trustworthy (especially Turkey was looked doen upon). America won muslims lost that sort of thing. Pilgrim was very likeble and good developed he was not a shallow written person. I liked the deph of the story and, eventhough the spyelement was a bit overdone and hard to believe, the way all the storylines came together. But I don't think of it as a thriller.
the stranger meets euphoria
struggled my way through this book, with an open end for part 2 that I am not going to read....
2 stars, brain damage because of tiktok, was too stupid to find the hidden message or nod to current politics and honestly i dont care as well. going to read fantasy next xx
very beautiful book, i was hoping to find out more about loneliness as an intrinsic factor instead of loneliness caused by external factors (i.e. horrible trauma or aids)
Eye-opening book, would reccommend everyone to read this
okay miss couperus!!! Xx
To be honest with everyone, I read this book in the Dutch translation. And I thought some stuff was translated very badly. I think I should have read it in English to like it better. It's a thin book, which is already great cause I can take it with me to work and school. It's a very easy read. the following parts can contain spoilers.And I think everyone should read it. But I feel like it could have been written better. (I don't know if it's the translated version I read or the original version as well) But I thought some parts were a little boring. she could have described things better. But then again maybe she couldn't because things like this really hurt.I can't judge on the story itself because it's a non-fictional story. Which i think is very shocking. And it could happen to anyone. She did get me to hate her father. But also feel the regret she kinda had towards him. And I think it's very important for a writer (even if it's non-fictional ) to know how to get feelings like that towards their readers.The ending even brought tears to my eyes, I was so happy for her that she kind of got her happy ending, like in he did get arrested etc.I did find his letter at the end very wierd. I hated him for not admitting everything. Did he really love her if he keeps thinking about the consequences he will get for admitting something that is so true? For the shame he would have had to go through, but still has to go through at this moment. (karma) I'm glad he got what he deserved.The book however didn't really grab my full attention. I expected so much of it. I normally read books like this in a week or maybe even less. But it took me a good 2 weeks to get through, because I didn't feel motivated to start reading. And when I did read it made me tired and I quit reading it.I am glad that I read this book because it was so fascinating. It really shocked me that people can do stuff like this. I highly recommend this book to everyone, cause I feel that everyone has to know the story of someone who got sexually abused by her own father as a child. They should know it, recognize it and help to prevent it. I felt like this book was worth 2.5 stars, which is probably because of the translated Dutch version and the parts that were kinda boring. But since you can't give half stars, i'll give it 3. Cause it's a fascinating and shocking story that I think everyone should read. And I feel like the English version would have been way better.
I´m happy that I read this book way before the movie came out. Cause compared to the book, the movie is crap.This is one of the first books I read (when I got over the fase of hating books). The beginning is so cute, you're happy that they're together and they're all cute but then he dies. And I couldn't stop crying. Cecilia is an amazing writer. And this is her best book yet. The idea someone leaves you letters to move on with your life is so romantic. I could really relate to Holly throughout the book. And that's a must for a good book. Everyone I recommended the book fell in love with it.Don't watch the movie before you read it though! Cause the book is so much better, don't ruin it for yourselves. And if you did watch it. Don't compare the movie to the book. Seperate them from each other. the movie is a random movie and the book is a different book. You'll ruin it if you don't.
I bought this book in 2007, I started reading it immediatly. But I never liked it enough to keep reading. I decided on reading it again last month and I feel like it took me ages to read. I really liked the concept of someone who hates it when things go missing. Who starts a missing persons agency and then goes missing herself to end up on the place where the missing things and persons go. I was very excited to read this book from Cecilia as I loved ps;i love you. But the beginning really bored me. I forced myself to read it again a year later, failed and forced myself to read it again last month. It did get better, I liked her time at that place called Here. And I would find myself really feeling for her and Jack Ruttle. Cause I was dying to find out what would happend, if Jack would find his brother and most importantly Sandy. And if Sandy would get home and find the 'Here' place so she could 'free' all the missing persons.But the ending, I think, was horrible. I would have loved to know what happened to her 'missing' friends. If they would actually search for the 'Here' place. I'm kinda dissapointed in the ending.It has like 387 pages. Which should take me about 2 days to read. But it took me almost 2 months to read it. Not her best work.
*review might contain some spoilers* After reading the notebook i thought the books of Nicholas Sparks were those kind of books that are just beter when they're made into movies. So I was kind of dissapointed that I had already bought this one, but decided to give it a shot anyway. I absolutely adored the movie, and since i was kind of dissapointed by the notebook book version I automatically assumed that that would be the case for a walk to remember as well. The beginning kind of confused me but as soon I managed to forget about the movie the book became pretty good. It was pretty easy to connect to Landon, I could understand every thought he had. I find it very hard to write a review about this book because it is something so special, so beautiful and so so so sad. I could totally understand Landon, I understood why everyone found Jamie a little weird, or maybe not even a little but really weird. I mean, what teenage girl walks around holding a Bible and dresses like grans do? (even for the 50's) But then he got to know her better and everything got explained and it makes you feel guilty for feeling that way about Jamie. I pretty much went to every emotion that Landon had to go through.The characters in this book are all so wonderful, and so recognizable, and easy to connect to or to love even. Which is so hard to do as an author. I have to tell you that I'm a girl who easily relates to someone, but i feel like this book taught me something. It's one of those rare books that changes your opinion or views on something. I am so glad to have read this book, it was so refreshing and lovely and sad. I can deffinitely recommend this book. And I really hope that more people will learn a lesson or 2 from this tragic story.
I loved this book as a kid, Roald Dahl is an amazing writer.
really liked this one. I had never given much thought to Bree and found the whole hype around here recently kind of exaggarated, i mean she's in eclipse for like a minute?! But it was so interesting to read something from her perspective, to read something from the new-born's army prospective. I'd say this book is a must-read for all twilight fans. Be sure to read Eclipse first though!
I expected this book to be just as good as the movie was. I started reading it and I pretty much wondered why it didn't look familiar. And for as far as I can remember the book is really different from the movie. And I must say that I liked the movie way better. I enjoyed the book, but i pretty much kept on reading because I had nothing else to do during my 7 hour traintrip. I remember that Noah always got turned down by Allie in the movie, and I also remember thinking Noah was so damn cute and Allie was so cruel. And I thought it was so cute how he would do anything to make her say yes.. But nothing of that is in the book, and that was pretty much my first dissapointment.They fell in love like right away and that's where the story started, I remember thinking how he was going to fill the book with all the stuff that happened after Allie left, and he obviously managed to do that.I just noticed that I'm talking like he wrote the book based on the movie, but it's to be the other way around. I just feel like the movie was how it was supposed to be, perfect.The characters in the book meant nothing for me, while I probably wept through the whole movie. I must admit that the ending of the book both grossed me out as it made me cry. But I think I mostly cried because I remembered the ending of the movie, which was beautiful. But 2 elderly people making out described into details? ehh.. No thanks.I also think he could have saved us on the sex details. I sometimes felt awkward reading it, it was like something private. I usually don't care about reading that as long as the author manages to do it just right. That also means that we should be able to connect with the characters, which I thought wasn't the case with this book.But I at least had something to do during my traintrip and if you can manage to put the movie aside, you might even like it.
i really like the tv show and since we have to wait for a couple of months i decided to read the books. I was dissapointed the minute i started. I absolutely adore the tvshow but nothing is the same in the books. I managed to look at them apart from each other which made the book ok to read. there are some pretty exciting parts in the book, but also many lame ones. I do enjoy reading them though. But try to look at the book as something different than the tvshow, it's way more fun to read it that way!
Someone once told me about this book but I forgot the title. All I remembered was the storyline and how fascinated I was by the story.The following part contains spoilersSo I was looking around in the bookstore and I found the book. I was so happy that I found it, I had to buy it. I started immediatly and I couldn´t really bond with the boy in the beginning. But then again I have never been a 9 year old boy. It changed quickly as soon as they moved to what he calls Out-With (which should be Auschwitz) The innonence of the children and the ignorance of the adults was so obvious in this book. Which I'm glad about cause that was the case back then. And a story like this could have really happened.That may be why it's such a good book.It's written about a buy called Bruno, he's 9 years old and lives in Berlin. Then the Fury (Führer = Hitler) comes by his house to eat dinner. He offers his father a job in Auschwitz as a soldier. He has to accept the job. It is never fully explained in the book why it is. But you read enough to guess.They never give you more information than a kid from 9 years got.He hates the idea of moving somewhere else, as he has to leave his friends, house and everything he is so used to.He has an older sister, aged 12, that he finds very annoying. She is the Hopeless Case in his eyes. Something that should be relatable to a lot of us. As soon as he got to Out-With he's dissapointed. The house doesn't look a thing like the house in Berlin. This house has no extra room that he could go exploring. In this house there were just enough rooms for everybody to live in. There were no banisters that he could slide off. From the window from his room he could see a big fence, where a lot of people lived and always wore striped pyjamas.One day he was so bored that he went out to explore the fence. He walked for a long time and wanted to go back home when he saw a spot in the dsitance. He was so fascinated to find out what it was that the spot became a blob and the blob became a figure and the figure became a boy. A boy in a striped pyjama, who was staring down to the dust. That's when the story began. They got friends. Bruno would go see Shmuel every day.They would talk about everything.But then one day, Bruno's mum wanted to go back home in Berlin. Bruno didn't know what to do and his father decided to send his daughter, son and wife back to Berlin.Bruno went to see Shmuel and told him he was leaving in 2 days time.They decided to help Bruno be a Jew for one day, as some kind of adventure. The next day Bruno switched his clothes to a striped pyjama and crawled under the fence towards Shmeul's side of the fence.As soon as it got dark the soldiers whistled and the Jews had to go marching. They got led into a room, where Bruno told Shmuel that he was his best friend.And that's the last thing we read about Bruno & Shmuel.I was reading this at work, and tried my hardest not to cry. But that was a very hard thing to do.This book is something that everyone should read, and I will have to check out the movie as soon as possible.A very, very good book. Very well written!
I bought this book because I love the tv series so so much. A mistake, do not read this book if you like the tv show because it is nothing like it. It's completely different. To my opinion the tv show is way better.I tried to set them apart from each other, but I still didn't like the book that much when I did. I was kind of waiting for the dumb characters to find stuff out I already knew while opening the book for the very first time.
Many people recommended this book to me when i was reading Twilight. But there were also many people who told me not to cause they didn't like it. I like to give books a chance, cause everyone likes different kind of stuff.So i bought it right after I finished Twilight. And I started it immediately.I didn't get a thing of the whole thing in the beginning and I started to long back for Edward so i quit reading it and started the twilight saga again. Then when I was finished reading that I made a deal with myself to give all the books on my shelves (that I quit reading or never even gave a chance) a 2nd chance. And I'm glad I did!It was a struggle for me to get through this in the beginning but it got better and better and better. I had it finished in no time and I can't wait for a sequel. Stephenie writes her books like movies. You can picture exactly what she meant for you to see. And her characters are amazing! I went from not liking this book to loooooving it. I'm so glad I gave this book the 2nd chance it deserved. I will deffinitely read this again sometime. And I can't wait for this to be made into a movie!
This book is about Lucy, a girl from manchester who meets the One in Venice when she was 18 years old. They kiss underneath a bridge because according to some legend it will bind them together forever. They however split up. 10 years later Lucy moves to New York for work and she runs into him again. They then find out they don't like each other anymore and break up again. But... they keep running into each other. the legend. How do they get rid off that so they can get over each other?I enjoyed every bit of this book. The characters, the writing and the story. It was cute, fresh and exciting and i really cared for the characters. It was an easy read and you should read it if you like chicklit.
(could contain spoilers)This book is one of the cutest books I ever read. Cecilia Ahern is good in writing cute little love stories. And this one won't dissapoint you!The story is written in notes/letters/phonecalls/e-mails or chatsessions. And mostly go from Alex to Rosie or Rosie to Alex, although they would mail someone else during the book too. I never read a book before with this kind of concept so this was so new to me. And I didn't really like it when I heard about it. But as soon as I start reading it; i fell in love.In the first couple of letters they're only 8 years old or so, and they use the wrong grammar, they have cute little fights. You read along when Alex moves to the US, Rosie finishes highschool in Ireland and gets pregnant. Their first meeting, new partners etc. I had to keep on reading, and I took all the free time I could find in this book. It reads very easily because the letters are very short, and you have to read the answer on the letter before. You're finished before you know it.It's an amazing book. One that I wouldn't mind to read multiple times!
i've been a fan of Westlife ever since I can remember.And I can't help but falling in love with them every time a new album comes out.I'm not a big fan of artists writing their biographies. However I can't stop myself from buying the ones from artists I love (even though they didn't write it theirselves)This one however is written with Westlife. It has everything I always wondered about and more. Every band member gets to tell a part of the Westlife story. And it didn't bore me.I do think you have to be a fan to like it. It's a pretty good read when you're a fan. I really enjoyed it. And I think I will read it again someday.
I bought this book at the bookclub I'm a member of, and I didn't know what to expect from it.I had just read the twilight series, that had totally obsessed me in every kind of way. So it was very hard for me to start a new book, with no Edward or Bella.But as soon as I started reading it, I forgot about twilight for a while. Which is hard to do, believe me. This book is written in a very easy and cute way. The story and writing were great. The characters were easy to relate to and I really enjoyed reading this book.
I didn't get what was so good about the book when I just started reading it. But somewhere in the middle it got me hooked and thinking.Someone once told me it would change my way of thinking about God. And it kind of did. I'm not a religious person and I don't follow the Bible, but this book made more sense to me than most of the Bible stories I read.It's a very inspiring and sad book. It would make a great movie as well.
I bought the book before I saw the movie, and I went to see the movie the day after I bought it, just because it was its last day at our cinema. I probably shouldn't have done that. I really like the movie better than the book, and I never had that before. I could relate to the characters in the movie better than what are supposed to be the same ones in the book.The book started out great, I really thought it was a good book. I had to stop reading it a couple of times because I've had lots to do for school.Whenever I had the time to read, i didn't cause I just didn't feel connected to the book and to its characters. I forced myself to read it because I have a stack of other books I want to read. And I feel like every book deserves a 2nd chance. So I always finish the books I started.I really hoped the book would be able to get me to like the characters. But it didn't. It became duller with every page that got turned. I found myself not liking any of the characters, not Clare and deffinitely not Henry. This book, is to my opinion a pretty thick book. And I don't mind reading thick books, but reading this one felt like an eternity.If you would take all the stuff that isn't important out of this book, you would have a very thin book left. It might also have been a better book that way anyway.Another thing that I didn't like was that the writer seemed to impress all the readers with her knowledge of things. It felt like she was trying to prove stuff. She just had to describe almost everything they did while having sex, and I wouldn't mind that if I had to read it once. But I had to read it a couple of times... it became kind of awkward. She also had to describe the food as if she knows everything about cooking. Henry was supposed to be a great cook. But I really don't care about the details of what they eat or want to eat or how they cook. It's not really that important for me to read in a book. I would buy a cookbook if I wanted to read something like that.She kind of did it with everything they liked or did:- Henry's preferences of music and bands, I think she tried to mention every punkband that exists in this world. Just to prove how cool Henry is, or how rebellious he is, which he obviously isn't.- Poems, she just loved to use poems in this book.- Chicago, where they lived, and where she lives. I really don't need or want to read all the details about the architecture in Chicago and how wonderful Chicago supposedly is.- Foreign languages. She kept on writing in German and French. I have the luck to be Dutch and follow a German class, but I have no idea what all the French stuff was about. And I doubt it that all the other readers (with some exceptions) got what she was going on about. That really annoyed me the most. I really thought this would be a great book, a sad book. But it wasn't. The movie was better, and that one confused me when i saw it. I'm not saying that I regret reading this book cause I enjoyed some parts of it. But I'm just saying that it could have been way better. I expected something way better.I mean, Henry is a time-traveler. How cool could a story like that turn out? And how uncool was Henry really in the book? I kind of didn't like Henry. And what about Clare? How tragic must it be to be waiting for the man you love, who's a time traveler, for most of your life? This book really wasn't that sad. I never got to like the characters, and when I came to the ending, I felt not enough connection to them to feel sad. Or to feel anything really. I was just glad that I finished the book and I could start a new one.
I. loved. this. book.I wasn't expecting too much of it as I found the movie a litte boring sometimes. Don't get me wrong, the movie is one of the saddest most inspiring movies I've ever seen. But, especially in the beginning, I would find myself getting a little sleepy.I really wanted to read the book in English, but decided to buy the Dutch one because it was on sale. But I don't think that should really matter.The minute I started it, I fell in love.This is one of the most inspiring, heartbreaking books of all time.The beginning wasn't boring at all to me anymore, and I will have to check the movie out again. There weren't differences in the beginning of the book, compared to the movie. (for as far I can remember the movie) And that's really rare as movies get changed so much that it doesn't even look like the same story. But they didn't really skip much of the book and stayed really true. And that's amazing. Cause the book is amazing, and the movie wouldn't have been any good if they changed the story a little.There are some really inspiring quotes. Like, the only real crime is stealing. Baba would tell his son Amir about this.If you kill someone, you steal someone's right to live, if you lie to someone you steal someone's right to the truth, if you betray someone you steal someone's right to be treated right.Etc, etc. (I don't remember the whole quote)And it's so true.There were many really good quotes that i won't go spoiling around!The fight scene in the book made me so neaseous. I'm the kind of girl who faints at the sight/thought/feeling/smell/everything of blood. And getting a description about someone who gets beaten up so badly, with bones crashing and everything was so disgusting. I was reading that part in the train and someone dropped something and that scared the heck out of me, as it was so real to me. I was so into the book that every sound around me scared me. I almost screamed. haha!And that's what's so great about this book, it absorbs you. It seems so real. It's like the writer really went through this.And the kid, Sohrab, was so heartbreaking. The things he had to go through, the things had to do, to see, to hear are just horrible. And it might be happening to someone right now at this moment. I've cried a couple of times through this book, but I also smiled, or hated, or loved. The book was so well written.The characters were so alive. They were characters you started to love or hate or maybe even fear. It was so real to me. Everytime I starting reading the book I ended up in a different place, I wasn't me sitting at home. I was Amir, the main character, in Afghanistan or the United States.This book changed my opinion of the whole mess in Afghanistan, it's just the whole idea of them being able to play with kites, such a simple toy, such an underestimated toy as well. And they're not even able to do that anymore. A kite resembles freedom to me at this point now. I used to look at a kite as a stupid toy, something I never liked to do. But reading this book changed my way of thinking. Kites to those kids means freedom, means childhood. Something some of them might never even know. Something that is so normal to us, is so foreign to them. And that, just breaks my heart.
I really, really enjoyed this book. After reading 2 books from Cecilia that didn't grab me I was so surprised that this one was so much better.It knew how to grab me from the very first chapter. And I finished it before I knew. It was a great read. And I would recommend this to anyone who likes chic-lits and Cecilia Ahern's books.I'm not a big fan of reading in multiple point of views. Cecilia surely likes to write that way, one chapter might be out of the female person and the other chapter would be written in the male person's view. And she's great at it. But I didn't enjoy it in a couple of her last books that I read.Although I didn't mind it with this book so much. I was so interested in what he would think and what she would think that I had to keep on reading to find out. Lovely book by a lovely writer.
was curious about this since the movie got some great reviews. but it must be one of the worst books i will ever read. It started out okay, it was very promising but it got worse and worse. The characters were boring and they made the story ten times as worse.
I bought this book as a joke, since I know someone with the name Johnny and found the title and concept hilarious. And it was on sale. I read the reviews later on and was pretty excited about all the good reviews it got, my friend read it before me and she really loved it. So i couldn't wait to start.I immediately fell in love with the book. It's very relatable and I bonded with Meg immediately. Like her, i fell for Johnny, and later even for Christian. However I have always loved Christian way better throughout the book than I had liked Johnny. I was dissapointed by some of her decissions. But I guess that is a good thing, it's still a book, not my diary. The story totally grabbed me and I couldn't stop reading it. I don't get why people don't like the last page of the book since that is one of the pages of the last couple of chapters that I do like. I'd say I didn't like how the last chapter ended, but I did like the epilogue to the last chapter. I really loved this book and I will deffinitely check out more work from this author. I can totally recommend this if you like chick-lits.
I´ve had a hard time to get into this book. I started it years ago but it didn´t get my attention to it. So I started again this year and it surprised me how I actually really liked it.I thought this was such a cute book, it might be the 2nd best one from Cecelia yet. I love cute little love stories like these. And I loved the middle parts of the book the best. I can´t wait to see this in a movie. Hugh Jackman as Ivan, I mean hello... He can be my imaginary friend anytime lol. No, really. It is a great book. But the ending was kinda lame. I didn´t expect anything like it. And I was pretty much dissapointed. This book could have gotten a better rating if the ending would have been better.But it´s a pretty good book, and worth reading.
I give it a 7. Really: fuck the 5 star rating system, I hate it! 7 out of 10, 70 out of 100, 70% score, that makes sense.I loved the first 80% of the book, then after that it got tedious and too many new characters were introduced. She should have ended the book earlier. Maybe a sequel would have been a better choice.I've traveled South Korea and Japan and I've read a lot about theit culture and history, and that made me appreciate this book.
7 out of 10
Disappointing. I put it away after 75 pages.
A must read!
A personal, detailed and (in my opinion) accurate description about what is feels like to run a marathon. The books starts with the failure of not completing a first marathon, then it's about training to try again, and then, km by km, a description of running a marathon.As a 4 time marathon runner, I enjoyed reading this book and recognized the emotions and details. This is book is for non-runners who are curious, for novice runners who want to know what is feels like to run a marathon, and also for experienced marathon runners who want to discover what someone else goes through when running a marathon.
This books requires some patience. I almost gave up after 70 pages in. After finishing it, I just feel that the first chapters aren't that great. Beyond that, it's compelling!
Awesome! Compelling. Good flow. Nice writing style. Even though it's fiction, it's quite plausible.
Interesting idea, extraordinary plot, but sometimes predictable. It was hard to try to sympathize with or like a character. The book was a little too long, should have wrapped up the ending a bit earlier.
4.5/10 and not 2/5. Fuck the 5 star rating system. I stopped reading after 254 pages, so about half way.The book kept dragging on and on. Everything was way too wordy and not much happened. Every event, every conversation dragged on too long. I really gave it a chance. I liked some parts of the book, really, but it just wasn't compelling enough to continue reading. I don't even want to know how this book ends.I liked the descriptions of the Swede and his family, NJ, the developments in Newark, the glove cutting, American culture.
Awesome! The jumping back and forth in time made it hard, and sometimes the language was overly complicated. For the rest, just awesome. Compelling, exciting. I liked the short chapters.9.8 out of 10 - screw the 5 star system!
7.5 out of 10 or 75 out of 100. Screw the 5 star rating system!What I liked:- Elaborate and interesting descriptions about Smilla's history and personality traits.- Interesting look into Greenland and Danish culture- AdventuresWhat I didn't like- The book was way too long- Lots of times the story skips and let's you guess too much, like "they're in a taxi", but not explaining who are in the taxi, why, and where they are going - just an example.
Mediocre.I read this book because is was highly praised. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pos...At about 70% in, there was an ending. I thought. And then it continued, and later there was another ending. Okay, that's interesting. The legal aspects were kinda interesting. At some points I found the storytelling good in a way that I could picture some of the scenes vividly.What I didn't like was that at times the book was kinda predictable. Also, the language and writing style (yes, I know it's an old book!) were sometimes confusing. Especially in the first half of the book, the writer uses 'it' a lot, without being very clear about what the 'it' refers to.Usually after reading a good book, I watch the movie. In this case, I am not excited enough to watch one of the movies that is made after this book.
A very detailed description of the life of Miep Gies, her relationship with the Frank family and the struggles in the war.In addition to reading history books and personal report by victims, I think this book is very valuable because it shows the situations, dilemmas and choices of a normal person trying to do the good thing. Miep Gies describes not only Het Achterhuis in detail, but also life in Amsterdam in wartime.
3.5 starsWhat idiot invented the 5 star system?7 out of 10.
Outdated, silly, absurd, overrated, inaccurate, and full of nonsense too.I read the book because it's mentioned everywhere, it's supposed to be a great classic, but now I found out it's just overly hyped.If you really want to educate yourself on love, sex, and relationships: talk to some wise people, find contemporary books, and maybe Google phrases like "how to be a good husband", "how to find and attract girls", "tips for dating", "tips for a lasting relationship", "satisfying your partner in bed", "tips for sex", "a successful marriage", "the 5 love languages", and you'll find great tips and knowledge that is rooted in science and much more trustworthy, accurate and up-to-date than the silly stuff in kama sutra.
The best of Godin about business, marketing, life. Be remarkable.
Written in 1983 and still the essence of organization.
At first sight a very inspiring book about a very inspiring concept: checking out areas all over the world where longevity - growing old healthy - is more common than elsewhere. But the book appears less profound than I expected after seeing the Netflix series. I expected the book to be the more profound layer under the series, but instead it is just a light redo which has little value after having already seen the documentary series. Reading the book shows the light way of doing research by Buettner. He seems to have a chat over here and a chat over there and that's seems to be his way of making rather big conclusions. For example - and that's a big show stopper for me - he keeps suggesting that drinking alcohol is not so bad or he even promotes it, while anno 2024 it's rather clear that alcohol is one of the most poisonous and nastiest addictions on hour planet nowadays. It's a cool book to get some inspiration from but after that: dive deeper and deeper yourself. The book is like a Lonely Planet guide. Cool to get a first glimpse, but by far not enough to prepare for a serious trip off the beaten track. It's too popular, too romantic, too easy, to light. Unfortunately.You'd better nog buy it. Wait for others to give it away :-)
Inspirational but not quite educative. Too much beautiful pictures, too little words.
The All You Need to Know about Laughter Yoga Book from the inspiring initiator of a world wide movement. What, how, why, personal stories, benefits, research based: everything is in the book. Great read. But: could have been half the size - in the second half there's a lot of repeating.
Impressive Story of an Impressive Life of an Impressive Grand Lady.
Cool
This bundle of stories by Robert Louis Stevenson is nice. Some stories are hit or miss though. I did really enjoy The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde, Markheim and the Body Snatcher. Also I did not see the love triangle in The Pavilion on Links coming lol
I enjoyed reading this book, the old modern English was getting uses to, but overall a very nice story
Feminine, gothic and gory. Just how I like it. Julia does like to write about teeth a lot btw
** spoiler alert ** So, I did not really get into it in the beginning. I found it to slow and did not care for the military school shit. But then there was war and war crimes committed and that I loved reading it. It was traumatising, especially chapter 21, but good. Sometimes I did thought that Rin was a bit goofy or, may I say, cringe. But she is 19 and on her way to herself the problem in everyone’s life, and I love that for her.
So it was nice, but not that memorable for me. Some really great phrasing, however some was also forgettable. I guess it did not leave me with a ‘wow’ as much as I hoped it would
Interesting read, but more a book I would recommend to people who just started having interests in gender studies. It explains concept that are used and references to different studies. However, there is not a final reference list which kind of annoys me personally.
I am a whore for Sappho
Great and interesting, but also very confusing at times
really loved this
A good book? yeah. However, I did not like the writing style all the time. Sometimes there were just too many interruptions. Plus, I found that the translations of the German words that were used took away the power of the words and distracted me from the story.
We stan narcisme
Pathetic little man written by a pathetic little man
Imma love this till the day I die, I think
3,5/5 A bit slow in the beginning, but it has a nice conclusion
Boy is depressed and takes it out on world by calling everything phony
BRIL-JANT!!!
Widely different reviews - very positive or very negative - and I can understand why. It is a very personal write up of a very personal affair: Dying. That's not everybody's cup of tea. My view is that it is an honest, authentic and explicit (!) epic of the main character, Morrie's, last months. His truth's are, in fact, simple and valuable at the same time. For some they may seem to be too simple. But when you open up and 'unto thine own self be true' ...
Nice book, well written and ... a bit too long :)
Extremely predictable but in the best way possible. I am tempted to quit my job and follow my Dreams of doing something I really love. ♡
Would’ve been a 3.5⭐️. Had some beautiful passages and incredible reflections on memory, time, remembrance, identity. The overarching story was too fantastical to really feel convincing or captivating.
I Just don’t really like love triangles
Steinbeck's 1960 travelogue of a journey across America in a camper van accompanied by his dog Charley. Steinbeck wanted to rediscover America with which he felt he had lost touch. He hoped to find out some truth or secret of what the American identity might be. He didn't find it. And although at times he felt very American, and at least wanted to feel part of the land and the people he was rediscovering, he seems to me quite apart from it, an observer most of the time. As he sets out people are envious of his quest. Who wouldn't want to embark on such a trip of adventure and discovery, but sometimes, especially towards the end of the journey Steinbeck makes the trip sound like hard work, a chore to complete and be done with, and that is a pity for the romantic reader.The writing is beautiful, the descriptions of nature, surroundings and people are fresh and never outdated. The book read as if written today, and I guess actually not much has changed in the more than sixty years since this trip was documented.
This is a book that you just have to give your self up to. It has no clear plot or timeline, it has no clearly defined or recognisable characters. Yet if it grabs you and you let go and follow, go with the flow, it becomes a book you will miss once you've finished the last page. The book chronicles at least two journeys, one along the Yangzi river, one in search of the Mountain of the Soul. Nothing is really found, the destination is never really reached. The book is like life, a series of endeavours, searches, a handful of random encounters, what the exact meaning of these events, quests and relationships remain unclear, maybe there is no meaning. Some of it is hard and cold and ugly and some of it is sweet and touching and beautiful. Gao Xingjian observes, notices and feels much, and he enjoys the fleeting happiness of the sun on his face or the mist on the mountain, a bird in flight, a snatch of song, the smile of a young girl...He contemplates unfairness, disaster and the stupidity and cruelty of man. In the end he understands nothing. I recognised a lot in his thoughts and writing. He paints a picture of rural and metropolitan China in the 1980's, a time I know well as I spent much of the eighties in China, studying and travelling, and learning about life. Finally, Gao Xingjian's concern for nature preservation and the awareness he shows of the harm he sees man doing to it, is surprising for a writer in 1980's China. I loved and will miss this book.
An old woman, living alone in the seclusion of her home and garden in Northern Italy, ponders her life and the choices she made in a letter to her granddaughter who is struggling to find her way in life by traveling in the US.The letter is an open confession of a lifetime of struggles, mistakes, choices, revelations and insights, full of love, full of wisdom, boiling down to the basic advice from grandmother to granddaughter to listen to and follow your own heart in life.Full of memorable quotes, recognisably human. Relations between parents and children and grandchildren are full of misunderstanding despite the love... Touching without being too sweet. I liked the references to The Little Prince, which is my favourite book.
Clever atmospheric stories. Well written.
Delightful adventure in the Arctic wilds of Canada of a young biologist sent to study the life of wolves. As so often his research was meant to prove, validate and underpin the accepted government policy of wolf eradication. The interpretation of the results were fixed and the outcome for policymaking too. This book is probably biassed the other way, that everything about the wolf is good. Still refreshing and positive to read. Nice to read a book about wolves from my own culture after reading the Chinese wolf novel Wolf Totem. What both books show is the knowledge and understanding of indigenous people living in close proximity to the wolves. They know it is all about balance.
Fairly grim short stories set in rural England around the First World War. I love D H Lawrences descriptions of people and places. In a few pages Lawrence draws you into a whole new world. The people and their surroundings come alive, so much so that I had to stop reading the story England, My England, because I sensed something bad was about to happen to the main protagonist...
This book is an easy read. The decriptions of self-reflection of the main protagonist Don are very clever and funny and give a good picture of attention deficit disorder or autistic behaviour. Before I started reading this book, I thought the main female character Rosie was a barmaid, but she turns out to actually be a PhD-student. That was disappointing. Why couldn't she just be a barmaid?I guessed the final outcome of the plot very early on in the book. No surprises, but an amusing read.
I loved Essays in Love. The combination of a fictional love story and relevant philosophical and psychological thought on the various phases and aspects of love was most enjoyable. This book The Course of Love follows the same concept but focuses not on young love like the former book, but on the love and life of a married couple over the years. I enjoyed reading the book. It was thoughtful, much of the trials and tribulations of the fictional couple are recognizable, and De Botton does much to clarify behaviour and offer explanations and solutions to common problems of marital life. His point seems to be that people must approach relationships with less expectation of perfection. Count your blessings, be more understanding towards each other, give more love without expecting to be loved in return. It is a wise and mellow book, but it touched me less than Essays in Love. That book made me cry...
I liked O'Brian's style of writing. Beautiful descriptive prose. My problem with this book is that I felt little sympathy for the main character Nora. Despite the troubled relationship with her abusive father and husband I felt little understanding for Nora's relationships with men and her choices in life. She had a lot going for her in life, her looks, interesting career, her son, her friends, and still... The blurb on the back of my edition says "love and hope walk hand-in-hand with barely concealed violence and despair: where a woman is driven, despite herself, to exact revenge for suffering". I did not read this sentiment in this book. I read only self-pity and selfishness. The dramatic deed of the book is not, to my mind, an act of revenge for suffering, but a cowardly inability to face up to reality and take responsibility for one's own choices in life. Maybe it's dated?
A young Chinese man Ji Guoqing leaves his country hoping to find a better life in Europe. After a harrowing journey he ends up as an illegal immigrant in Paris, riding the metro all alone with no money, no friends, no home. Paris is, of course, not the paradise he dreamt it would be. The life of an illegal immigrant is loneliness, hardship and struggle to survive. Although he makes quite a good go of it, finding work, love and a residence permit, his betrayals of old friendships, homesickness and constant questioning of his dreams and decisions cause him much inner turmoil. When he realises that his flight from China has not solved any of his existential problems, he takes a last difficult decision.I did not like the book. It is poorly written and the translation did it no further justice. What I did appreciate was the basic content of the book. It was interesting to read about how Chinese illegal immigrants find their way to Europe and what dangers they face and how hard or how easy it is for them to get here. Once they are here they find work and struggle in a hard and boring life, not worth the trouble. I liked reading about the inner turmoil of the main protagonist Ji Guoqing and how he never can say what he actually feels, holds back his real feelings at crucial moments. I think this is what men quite often do and it would make life easier if they didn't. I found the end of this book very disappointing and dissatisfying. Bad book but still worth reading. The bilingual edition is very nice for Chinese language learners.
Autobiographical account of Laurie Lee's walk in 1934 from the Cotswolds to London and then on to Spain to start his independent life and make his fortune. Laurie tramps through Spain viewing everything around him "with the beauty and freshness of a young man's vision", ultimately getting caught up in the violent outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. One of the best books I have read in a long time. Laurie Lee writes beautifully and his subject matter is compelling. You wish you could have been there too...
Gorgeous book containing three short stories about the lives of young men in the wilderness of Montana. The book describes with true love the beautiful but hard, rugged mountains, the cruel working life and dangerous leisure time of the men living in these parts. The book draws you into the unknown and alien worlds of loggers, pimps, gamblers, forest service rangers and fly-fishermen, and describes them with a love and humanity that shows the reader there is real poetry and beauty in these tough guys worlds.Norman Maclean gives the word "beautiful" the deepest meaning I have ever read into that word.
Collection of short stories about the trials and tribulations of teachers. All stories set in a Dutch small town secondary school, the book paints a rather grim picture of the teaching community. Teachers struggle to keep going in a world full of power struggles, jealousy, competition, gossip and bullying. Even good and happy teachers can fail and be destroyed by the slightest change in the fine balance they try to keep. The terrible thing is that the stories are so recognisable and true to life. A little bit upsetting reading for those of us who want to be good, happy teachers.
As a child I loved reading fairy tales, myths and legends from all over the world. I love Scotland, so I enjoyed these stories very much.
I have wanted to read this book for a long time. I enjoyed reading it very much. It is a novel with an interesting mix: a detective murder mystery, and a learned book on religion, church and state politics in medieval times. Eco shows himself extremely erudite and knowledgeable. Perhaps a bit too much at times. Sometimes I didn't understand what I was reading. I am obviously not clever enough. Still I read the book with pleasure, turning the pages to find out what was going on in the mysterious monastery and who was responsible (and why) for the murders and strange goings-on taking place there. I learned a lot about church politics and religious factions and clashes of the time, which I found interesting. I was particularly interested in the heated debate as to whether Jesus believed the church (and himself) should strive to follow the path of poverty or that of possessions, power and grandeur. It is a debate still going on today in the church, recently also voiced by our Dutch celebrity priest Antoine Bodar in his criticism of Pope Franciscus' simple, basic style (poverty), which he finds unworthy of a pope.Now I would like to see the movie,
Very enjoyable and thought provoking book. Can't say anything about the story so as not to spoil it for future readers. I like the philosophical thoughts about history (on all scales), about the limits of documentation as well as perception and memories. Also I like the realisation that you think you remain the same person all your life, but how you can suddenly be confronted with your former self and realise you are not the same person at all anymore.
I chose to read this book because in the past I worked with the author. I got to know her as a very serious hard-working academic. I was curious to read her novel. I enjoyed it. I liked the form she used, setting the scene of doom at the very beginning of the book and working back up to that inevitable outcome through diary notes left behind by the main character and a snippet of film script of the movie her best friend, the I character of the book, makes of her friend's life.The book is very atmospheric, using quotes and lines from Conrad's Heart of Darkness to show that not much had changed between his time and the 1960's depicted in this book in the way the Europeans experience Africa.Having worked and lived abroad myself in a very different culture to my own (however, not in Africa), I could relate to the main character's sympathy with the plight of the local people and her wish to get to know and understand them better. And also her wish to fit in and play a positive role in their development. I understood her growing alienation from her husband's very expat, if not colonial, attitude to life and work in Congo and the dilemmas this alienation presented her with. I would have liked a different end for Ellen...Now I have to read Heart of Darkness.
Book was an OK read, but it felt more like a very average young-adult romantic love story than a proper novel. Nothing memorable about it. Disappointing, because I remember really enjoying Esther Freud's Hideous Kinky. Lara and her father, who she hardly knows, go on a holiday to Italy to stay with an old friend of her father's. There she meets the rich Willoughby family, a family full of intriges and secrets. She falls in love with the son Kip and goes through a lot of turmoil, soul-searching and coming-of-age trauma. The book ends with nothing particularly clear or meaningful... I liked the descriptions of the Italian food and the Palio horse race in Siena.
I enjoyed reading this book. However, to me it was just entertainment, nothing more. For me life is too short to read too many books without some deeper meaning, beauty, insight or knowledge. I need literature not just reading material. I liked the character Strike (different, likable). Robin could have had a stronger role in the book. J.K. Rowlings writing style (Harry Potter) was recognizable. I admire her for the way she changed her life with her writing talent. I wonder if she will try her hand at literature next.
I loved this book. I love Scotland, I love mountains. But this book does more than take me back to Scotland and the mountains. It takes me home into my own heart, body and mind. My almost daily walks are not in the high mountains, but in Dutch polder landscape, a little woody area and small reedy, marshy ground. Like Shepherd, I know and love my little bit of nature, it has it's own beauty, and is new to me everyday. I experience it each time in different light, different air, different emotion with all my senses. My communing with nature comforts and grounds me. I feel very much part of my place. It is a joy and a necessity. Jeanette Winterson says it in her Afterword exactly the way I feel it: "I am remapped by the book."[..]. I remember myself, my world, my body, who I am. The Foreword by Robert MacFarlane and the Afterword by Jeanette Winterson add extra depth and value to this lovely book. What a perfect way to start my 2020 GoodreadsReading Challenge.
Excellent book introducing and explaining the basic principles of traditional Chinese herbal medicine, its history, present and future. Daniel Reid describes the art and practice of Chinese herbal medicine as it is used today and also tries to impress upon us the potential of combining Chinese herbal medical treatment with modern Western technology to achieve a more effective medical system. I lived in China for many years and experienced for myself this best-of-both-worlds combination. I love the way Traditional Chinese Medicine does not only seek to remove the symptoms of an illness, but seeks to find the cause of the illness and restore balance and health by dealing with the root of the problem. I also love the wisdom of nurturing life and health through proper living habits, diet and exercise, and how the ancient Chinese already understood this. There is so much we can do ourselves to remain healthy. The book includes a large illustrated section called the Herbal Companion introducing individual herbs and other items used in Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine explaining how they are used. Very nice!
I finished the first volume of this wonderful book, the most famous Chinese novel. 3 more volumes to go. I will write my review when I have finished the entire book.
Book about the loneliness and purposelessness in the life of Paul, a man living in the farmhouse in the eastern part of Holland, near the German border, in which he was born fifty years ago. He never left home, still living in the parental farmhouse caring for his old ailing father who once cared for him when he was a child, after they were both deserted by wife and mother. Nothing much happens in this quiet rural area. Still change comes with outsiders moving into the age-old area: a crashed Russian pilot, Chinese restaurant owners, Asian prostitutes, Russian, Polish and Romanian workers and criminals. Change is inevitable, but hard to bear.Loyalty, care and friendship born out of the very real fear of being deserted, left behind and remaining alone. A sad, dark book, full of regret and helplessness, Very beautifully written. I just wonder why so many Dutch male writers, and Tommy Wieringa is one of them, need to write about crime and prostitution to convey human feelings of love, loss, fear, sadness. Is there not enough feeling left in ordinary lives and situations to write about? Why do they need to over-magnify and caricaturize the blackness of life to be able to touch on and speak of human feelings?
Liked it a lot. Intriguing Chinese sci-fi novelette which depicts inequality in society in an unusual but very convincing way. The futuristic society depictied in the novelette is strangely similar to Chinese society or other societies as they exist today. Not focussing on rebellion against inequality, the novelette shows us how people learn to live with inequality and injustice, making the best of their own lot and trying to find, in their own situation, the things that matter in life like beauty, consolation and love...
Very interesting book about the mysterious and very special life of the cuckoo. Sometimes a little too scientific for easy reading, but I learned so much about this fascinating bird.
I really wanted to like this book. The blurb on the back of the book tells me that the story takes place in a small village in a remote Chinese mountain area and it follows the herbalist and barefoot doctor Mrs Yi. Young villagers admire her and start imitating her work, planting medicinal herb gardens and studying medicine. As they do so they discover that the line dividing life and death is porous and the mountain is mysterious. Can Xue explores the in-between spaces: between the living and the dead, healer and sick, nature and us. This is all the stuff I really love, so my expectations were high. Yes, it's all there, but I found the novel very flat, the characters and the descriptions of the mountain, nature, nothing came alive for me. The action was very repetitive, boring. Everyone was so good and hardworking and so amazed about everything, I could hardly bear it. Some chapters left me completely puzzled, I didn't understand what was going on. Especially one chapter about the immanent end of the world... I am going to discuss thus book next week with my bookclub. Maybe my fellow clubmembers can help me understand and appreciate what I just read.UPDATE: My fellow clubmembers were equally dumbfounded and disappointed with this book. No plot no meaning, no purpose... Nobody understood or liked the book... I still would like to be enlightened by someone who did understand and appreciate this book... What did we miss?
This book is the debut of Dutch writer Hafid Bouazza (of Moroccan descent). The short stories take place in small villages in Morocco and in Amsterdam. The stories are surreal, fairytale-like and give an insight in family life, religious life, social control en secret sensual enjoyment of life. Many of the stories deal with a youthful dealing with the issues of identity and sexuality. I was intrigued by the strange world Bouazza describes and sometimes shocked and repulsed by the goings on in the stories... I would like to read a novel of his hand. The characters in the stories were interesting.
Perfect little book to read just after a holiday on the island of Texel, chosen home of the author Jan Wolkers. A little bit of an unbelievable suspense story, but I do love Wolkers' writing. He draws you in and makes everything believable. The best are his descriptions of nature. The plants, the birds, the sand, the sea, the dunes, rain you can feel it and smell and taste it. He is a great writer.
1892 collection of short stories by The Netherlands first realist novelist Louis Couperus. The stories all depict the theme of the collection (and it's title): Een illuzie (an illusion). All the stories have something mysterious and unfathomable about them. Reading the stories we enter closely into the feelings and imaginations of the protagonists and we follow them in their thoughts and see what they see, feel and hear whether it is real or not. Very compelling.
I read this book 35 years ago and it made no lasting impression then. Reading it now that I am older and have lived, it moved me. I understand now how one can focus one's whole life on, and move all to keep the flame of a lost love burning, holding on to a deep-seated desperate hope that this love can and must be regained because it is meant to be. I thought this kind of true love and constancy of feeling was a speciality of women. It moved me more that the constant heart in this book belongs to a man. I recognize his quest and his suffering and sympathise. The setting in the giddy, shallow bustle of the roaring twenties rich party scene of New York contrasts with the simplicity, sadness and loneliness of the hero's true love. I really liked this book.
Read this book, a small collection of interviews with Ai Weiwei, Chinese avant garde artist, architect and blogger (and more), after visiting his wonderful exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in October 2015. I love Ai Weiwei's art and wanted to know more about this artist. The interviews are informative, but Hans Ulrich Obrist too much likes to have us know how chummy he is with famous people in the art world. i found his name-dropping irritating. Just let Ai Weiwei speak!
As a novel it was not very good. But it is an important book in Chinese literary history. I believe it was the first book openly featuring the human tragedy of the aftermath of the cultural revolution. How can people who opposed, denounced and persecuted each other during the cultural revolution get along and carry on working together in the same university. How can they adapt to a time of new freedom, how can they learn to trust others or even trust themselves? I had difficulty getting into the story and the characters but found it interesting in the end.
The story of this book is worth telling for those who do not know it and that is why I give it two stars instead of the one star I would prefer to award.... Unfortunately, the interesting real life story is not well told in this book. Factually it is well organised, but as a novel, as literature it offers nothing. The characters are flat, there is nothing of a sense of drama or passion to the action. The main character Diane does not evoke any sympathy in the reader. From beginning to end she remains a priviledged, selfish, unthinking, uninteresting girl. Even the love story is unconvincing.
Interesting, easy to read book that can be of help in understanding the world which seems at present to be in a state of transition: what with Europe in trouble, Russia gaining power, unrest in the Middle East and the economic rise of China. Haroon Sheikh sees this signs of the end of the Atlantic Era. Power seems to be shifting eastwards away from the Atlantic powers.In this book Sheikh views the economic and geopolitical changes happening now on the Eurasian plain from the viewpoint of six different players in the field: Germany, Eastern Europe, Russia, Turkey, Iran and China, trying to uncover the contours of the new world order. Interesting to see things from different points of view and to understand how the history of the different regions and countries influences their approach to the present and future. Also interesting to realise how much of history and the development of nation states is so politically and sometimes arbitrarily formed. Scary.As a nit-picking Sinologist I was irritated by Haroon Sheikh's mistakes in the use Chinese names when writing about China. He calls the Chinese thinker Zhang Weiwei, repeatedly by his given name Weiwei, instead of his family name Zhang. And gets the name of the new Silk Road development initiative"One Belt, One Road" wrong. Small irritating mistakes that could easily have been avoided by the author or his publisher.
Rereading this book that was important to me in the late 1980's when it newly appeared in translation. The book is full of interesting philosophy and thoughts relevant to love and life in general. I still love it. The first time I read this book I was amazed at the recognition I felt when reading about the lives and thoughts of the various characters. I felt the writer knew me personally and was exposing my lovesick heart and mind, especially in the character of Tereza. It made me deeply sad. How we humans are a puzzle to ourselves, how we make decisions we know are detrimental to ourselves and still stick with them, how sad, sick and desperate love can make us feel, and our own thought-constructs of love can make us feel, how we hurt those we love best, against our will sometimes, but impossible to stop. The book shows that life's choices are difficult, heavy and light at the same time, because we know we can only ever make one choice. Rereading the book thirty odd years on, I still feel much the same. However, I recognise myself, my thoughts and feelings now in almost every character. My reaction to the book is milder, more accepting than when I was young. Apparently I have grown.
I love this book. Beautifully written with love and understanding about the changes in society and human relationships in Indonesia in the last days of the colonial era and the second world war. These changes are depicted in the story of the pure and unquestioning childhood friendship of the son of a Dutch plantation administrator and the son of a local Indonesian plantation worker. Their very different background and culture, the changing times and historic events cause them (sadly) to drift apart as they grow up, finally leading to the question whether, despite their joint and intimate childhood and youth, and their perceived friendship, they ever really knew or understood eachother.
Lovely, and beautifully written little book of autobiographical and philosophical essays by aviator and author of my favourite book The Little Prince, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The book describes the wonder of flight in a time when flying was new and adventurous, magical and dangerous. The book includes the story of how he survived a plane crash in the Sahara, and what this experience meant to him in his further life. He writes about the importance of having a clear purpose in life, and becoming aware of the unique part we play, in order to be happy, to be able to live and die in peace. The book is full of memorable and thoughtful quotes that can serve as encouragement at difficult times, or when searching for meaning in life. I love how, in reading, one good book often leads to another. This book was Hobie's cherished parting gift to Theo in the Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. Wind, Sand and Stars is a book I too will cherish and reread again and again.
Book of poems and short prose by Dutch writer and poet Nico Dijkshoorn. He is best known for writing poems on the spot inspired by the themes and guests of the daily TV-show De Wereld Draait Door. He is always direct, but insightful. His writing is humorous, but always with a touch of sadness, maybe nostalgia, maybe melancholy, always understanding.The pieces are about all sorts of little things in life, which we might focus on for a moment, if we happen to do so, and the feelings they evoke in us. Some recognisable to many, some very private. In this time of year when I find myself looking inward, weighing things up again, a nice book to read. Nico Dijkshoorn touched a chord more than once.
Short book describing the everyday life and events marking the unfolding tragedy of an ordinary Jewish family during the second world war in the Netherlands. The story is told by a young girl who, after the war, turns out to be the only survivor of her family. The dispassionate, clear and simple everyday language of the book brings home the message that the tragedy of war and persecution could happen again any day and to anyone. It was hard for her and her family to imagine the disaster that was to befall them, her parents remaining optimistic till the end.
I enjoyed reading this book, a serious biography of Beatrix Potter. I am impressed with Beatrix' development from a dutiful daughter kept close to her parents with little life of her own to a financially independent woman, a successful writer, artist, land owner and farmer. Her contributions to children's literature and to the preservation of nature and traditional farming in the Lake District are enormous. I admire her greatly for following her own path and creating a life in nature, a life she loved. The book was well=written and captivating, despite being really thick.
Ok book. Abdolah is an Iranian Dutch writer. The story could be partly autobiographic as it's about a Persian refugee in teh Netherlands who want to be a writer. I liked the use of snippets from famous Dutch literary works referred to in the book by the main protagonist as inspirational. I like the multi-culti idea of the universal culture.The crow figures in all the story lines. I like crows.
Mulder, a Dutchman living in Paris, leads a privileged but lonely life. Everyday he walks the same walk through his neighbourhood, observing his surroundings and the people in it, but not engaging with anyone or anything. One day a building housing illegal immigrants goes up in flames. A dog jumps from the building, tail burning, into Mulder's arms and into his life. The dog introduces him to an unknown world of illegals, refugees, beggars, criminals, people living on the streets. Through the dog Mulder is confronted by his own attitudes, opinions and feelings about these people and about his own way of life, and forced to rethink his position and take action instead of looking away. He crosses his own boundaries and tries to do good. But doing good is not so easy and others are not always grateful or willing to accept his charity. At the end of the novel Mulder is alone again, but changed by his experience.
Basic book on food culture in China. A summing up of lots of information. I did not learn much that I did not already know after living in China for eight years. The book contains many mistakes in the Chinese words and transcriptions used, which is annoying. I liked the recipes at the end of each chapter very much, and will definitely try a few out.
Dutch selfhelp book offering insight in how our constant search for love and recognition stems from fundamental selfrejection. We try to compensate this selfrejection by obtaining the love and appreciation of others. This however has an opposite effect. It makes us dependent on love, recognition and relationships. It makes us mess things up. Through meditation we can free ourselves of selfrejection, accept our painful emotions and reach a state of pure being, free from selfinflicted dependency and constraints, full of unconditional love and clarity. I earlier enjoyed his book on how parents mess up their children in their upbringing. In this book Geurtz uses the same line of Buddhism-based thought to explain relationship-dependency, and other types of addiction. I like his clear simple style of writing and his positive practical approach to freedom of dependency.
I learned a lot from this collection of classical Chinese animal fables. The most important thing being that stories with talking animals are rare in Chinese literature because what was written was supposed to be the 'truth', and talking animals do not exist. Strangely enough, most stories are actually basically the same story of a dispute between two or more animals, who then put their case before a judge, usually King Yama in the underworld (in case one or both of the animals died due to their dispute). They present their complaint and King Yama passes judgement.The book is somewhere in between a scholarly study and a book of animal fables just to read for pleasure and enjoyment. It is not one or the other and therefore possibly a little bit disappointing for either type of reader.I read the book for my Chinese literature in translation Book Club and although I dragged and struggled a bit reading the book (I just want to read a good story in bed), discussing it together was enjoyable and provided more and deeper insight).
Reread the book (second reading) after recommending it to a recently bereaved loved one. He did not like it. I still love it.
I loved this book, although it was by no means an easy read. I will have to read it again and again to understand it better. The main character Orlando, a young Elizabethan nobleman, lives for over 300 years (until 1928) experiencing many strange adventures including a sudden sex change from man to woman. He/she adapts to and, after much deep contemplation, accepts all changes. The book is about the utility of poetry, and the purpose and meaning of love and life. Through Orlando's adventures and thoughts Virginia Woolf examines many issues of human existence, among others the way society dictates distinct and in her opinion unnecessary, male and female gender roles.
Lovely short novel about a young girl living in a very small isolated village in New England in the early 1900's. Charity Royall is originally from the wild outlaw mountain people of the area, but was brought up by lawyer Royall and his wife in the village. After the death of her foster mother she lives a stifled boring life with her lonely foster father. The novel describes her sexual and emotional awakening caused by a sweet summer love affair with a young visiting stranger to the village. Beautiful nature descriptions complement and enhance the development of feeling in the young girl and that of the plot of the story. With this story Edith Wharton also shows the lack of choice women of the time had to make independent choices about the course of their lives. There is a sad fatality to the outcome of this beautiful touching story. Some loves are not meant to last, however that does not make them less beautiful, less meaningful or less memorable.
The book tells the story of a dysfuctional family with the older child desperately trying to help his parents and younger brother, solving all their problems, keeping the peace and keeping up apperances for the outside world. Far too much for a young child... tragic... When he meets Eva he finds someone he believes he can trust, someone to whom he might escape from his own unhappy stressful life.
I enjoyed this little book of short stories even more than the long novel "Liefde van een half leven" by the same author, Eileen Chang, which I read earlier this year. The short stories give a clear picture and a keen and very human-feeling insight into day-to-day life, the trials and tribulations of people of various social strata in wartime Shanghai. The tension in the story Lust, caution is amazing.Sometimes Chinese literature can be a bit cold and alienating, making it difficult for the reader to empathize with the characters depicted. Eileen Chang's characters are very real and recognisable. Some knowledge of Chinese history and culture helps, but is not necessary to follow and enjoy.
Very well-written and compelling novel by Dutch author Peter Buwalda. Captivating plot and convincing characters. I couldn't put it down. It never ceases to amaze me how people can let themselves be hounded by "what other people think" and revert to lies and complex cover-ups which in fiction, as well as in real life, will always be found out... I grew up on the campus of Twente University (Tubantia University in the book), and it was really nice to read a major novel set in Enschede and more specifically on the campus grounds.
It took me absolute ages te finish reading Wolf Hall. I found it a difficult book. For one because I do not know that much about the history of the period, but mainly because of the language used and the way of writing. I was constantly unsure about who was speaking in the dialogue and often had to reread passages to make sure.However, I did find it an interesting book and I actually liked the character Thomas Cromwell a lot.I was suprised when an Englishman told me recently that Cromwell must have been a terrible person. After finishing the book, I want to know what happened next. I already have got the sequel Bring up the bodies off the bookshelf.
This is one of the books I've read AFTER seeing the movie. The movie is brilliant and really scary. The idea of "the other mother" is very disturbing, as is the notion of selfish love as something potentially threatening, dangerous and even evil. Of course having seen the movie detracted from the impact of the book, I prefer the other order. But the book brought the message home and painted the same gripping picture in simple language. Coraline is a very appealing character. She is very recognizable and you are rooting for her to win the challenge throughout the book. She (and with her the reader) learns a lesson about selfless love in the process.
Real life story about a NY temp secretary who is dissatisfied with her life and takes on the challenge of cooking all the recipes in Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" in one year in order to get some sense of achievement and fulfilment. The book follows her ups and downs and personal development trying to beat this challenge.I very much like the idea of the challenge, but I didn't much like Julie. There seemed to be very little love and enjoyment in pursuing this quest, until maybe the very end, which I enjoyed. The book did make me want to try out some Julia Child recipes. I started with Potage Parmentier... :-)
Book of stories depicting the lives of ordinary Chinese people living in present day Nanjing. The stories are ugly and sometimes disconcerting. Most stories tell of lives going dreadfully wrong because of small misfortunes caused by hormones getting the better of the characters depicted. I read this book for my Chinese literature book club. I hated it. I didn't want to read these ugly stories. I only got about halfway, very unusual for me... My fellow book club members were much more positive than me, citing some of the stories further on in the book as believable and even enjoyable. So I persevered and finished the book. Perhaps I was less stressed reading the rest of the book. Or more open minded because of my friends' positive reviews, but I actually started enjoying the book. Still I hope modern day life in Nanjing is not as weird and ugly as the lives depicted in this book.
This is one of the most popular and best read novels in Holland. I read it a long time ago when i was a student. It describes the complex feelings of love of a somewhat autistic young university professor Maarten. The novel describes his youth as the omly son of a very religious (strict protestant) horticulturist. Maarten has a special relationship with his mother. The novel describes her death and the deep feeling of loss he experiences. maarten never had a relationship with a girl and remains stuck in feelings of unrequited love for a girl at school. He suffers from compulsive thoughts of impending death.During a lecturetour in Switserland Maarten almost dies, experiences new love. these dramatic experiences set him free. he can let go and accept his life.I enjoyed rereading this book after so many years. With more life experience I could empathise more with Maarten. I could understand his longing and his strange behaviour. The descriptions of nature and of the dramatic action in the book are very vivid. The movie of the book was quite succesful.
When I was an Anglophile teenager and in my early twenties I read and loved most of Jane Austen's novels. Now in my fifties I want to read them again and see how they hold up to the taste of the middle aged reader I have become. After reading Northanger Abbey I find I still love Jane Austen. This book is a mix of an entertaining story about a young girl's introduction into adult society (away from her family for the first time in her life) in Bath and a critical satire against the popular Gothic novels of the time.What I liked most was the description of the young girls' behaviour and feelings. Not much has changed to present day. The characters are so real and believable they could exist, just as described, today. The book is funny, light and enjoyable, but also a clever literary satire that was very relevant and topical in Jane Austen's day.
Short novel probably inspired by the real life story of an unknown man who appeared on the shore near Sheerness in 2005 without identification and refusing to speak. Because the only way he expressed himself was by playing the piano, he became known in the media as "the pianoman". He later turned out to be a German hoax. The main character of this novel Thomas Boender experiences a similar adventure.This novel focusses on how growing up with parents who are mostly silent all day long can influence the life of a child. People who do not express themselves enough can become "heavy" with unspoken words and unexpressed feelings, leading to disaster.The book, although set in modern times, was strangely timeless.Not bad, I would like to read other works by Bernlef.
Clever little novel about a self-help book author who decides to use his psychology skills to solve a problem in his own family. Not a good idea.
Hard, sad and honest (autobiographical) story of the last period of life and death of the author Van Dis' mother. He reflects on their unsatisfactory relationship, she distant, hard and cold, and he even as an adult, still yearning for her love and affection. They argue, fight and irritate each other. But also love and respect each other. His mother had a hard life, first as the daughter of a widowed sugar farmer in Zeeland, then as the lonely young wife of an Indo officer in the Dutch army in colonial Indonesia, in the Japanese prisoner of war camps, and later as the repatriated unmarried partner of a physically and mentally war-scarred Dutch soldier, Van Dis' father. At the end of her life the mother confides in her author son, and tells him much about her life he never knew. She instructs him to write down everything she tells him. In this process the son gets to know and understand his mother a little better. I found it quite a sad and moving book.
Very enjoyable reading. I was fortunate enough to have studied Sinology under professor Erik Zürcher at Leiden University in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Reading this book describing Zürcher's first visit to China in 1964 through his letters to his wife in Holland and excerpts from his travel diary, was wonderful. It was like hearing him speak again. I went to China as a student for the first time in 1981, many years later, but still at a time when China was relatively closed to the outside world. Zürcher's notes on things in China that catch his attention, surprise, delight or annoy him are very recognisable. The book brought many of my own early China memories back to me with fondness.
Pieter Omtzigt has clear views about what he thinks is needed to fix the damaged rule of law in the Netherlands, and to rebuild lost trust between government and the people. It will not be easy. He also asks for an active change in attitude both from government as well as the people. Omzigt won big with his new political party NSC (New Sociaal Contract) in recent elections, but not big enough to be able to put his ideas into action easily. Although not necessarily my political choice, Omtzigt is a sensible person, but sensible is not considerd very attractive these days. We will wait for the outcome of government formation talks.
This is an excellent Dutch children's book (not only for children). The book won the first Jan Wolkersprize for the best nature book of 2013. It's about a young boy who has a collection of insects he keeps in the basement. In the book he is "at war" with his older brother (a drummer in a rock band) over the right to use the secret basement. The brothers share a deep tragic secret which complicates their teenage struggles. In reading this book you can learn a lot about insects and the comfort that nature (even insects) can bring us in times of need.The drawings in the book are wonderful!
I chose this book because it got rave reviews on the goodreads site. It did movr me and I liked the Dutch connection (being Dutch), but I think maybe young adult books are not for me anymore. My 13 year old son loved it and stayed up all night to finish it.
From the beginning this book gripped me with it's dark suspense and sense of impending doom even while describing the calm contented life and peaceful surroundings of rural Groningen where it takes place. Story about Bepol, the owner of a small failing shipyard in provincial Groningen during the recession that followed the First World War. Peacefully content with what he has achieved in life and intent on providing a secure life for his daughter Ilse, as well as finding a worthy succesor for his business, he offers her hand in marriage to his best worker Niesten. Niesten is a mysterious figure, a taciturn, strong, hard working man who often disappears to Germany for weeks on end. Bepol, is strangely attracted to Niesten, because he is everything Bepol himself is not. When Niesten wants to make his mark in the business, acquiring a big order from Germany to build an advanced sea tugboat, Bepol's emotions become a complicated mix of hurt, obsessive admiration and jealousy. These emotions and obsessive imaginings cause Bepol to make a simple decision that will lead to ultimate disaster.
A young lonely Japanese man goes to see the doctor because he has not been feeling well and learns that he is terminally ill and soon to die. On his return home he is visited by the devil who offers him a deal: he can live for an extra day at a time if the devil may remove one item from the world. This seems like a good deal, as the young man is not ready to die yet. In this process he learns a lot about himself and his own life, and ultimately he begins to understand what things, places and people really matter and what makes life beautiful and worthwhile. A lovely little book, that touched me and set me thinking.
Very good Dutch children's book about a post-Third World War futuristic society in a climate-changed Greenland. The country named Thule is run by women, a paradise of the simple life focussed on nature, no army, no weapons. One day a warship from an unknown land arrives in the fjord bearing men whose sole intention is to conquer this beautiful land for their own profit. The people of Thule are forced to deal with this unknown menace and are brought into conflict themselves with their peaceful, simple, natural way of life. I liked this book a lot, children's books are also good for grownups. This book was recommended to me many years ago by my permaculture teacher Taco as an example of how we can learn from nature how to organise our society and way of living. Reading the book in times of the Corona-crisis, it rings true. So many of our taken-for-granted ways are illogical and seem dangerous and foolish when we try to explain or defend them. Countries run by women seem to be doing better in dealing with the Corona-virus. Food for thought.
This was the perfect book to read on my summer holiday in Scotland this year. Not quite in Skye, but quite near. I picked the book off the bookshelves in the cottage we stayed at in Lochcarron. Outdoor activities in the hills and on the beaches prevented me from finishing it whilst there. Luckily I could lay my hands on a copy and finished it at home. The book by poet and essayist Alexander Smith describes a long summer vacation spent in Skye in 1864, including the journey there and back to his home in Edinburgh. His writing is lovely, fresh and evocative, you can picture Skye, the mountains, the sea ,the people, as clear as if you were there walking with him. His feelings and words are in no way out-dated, but fresh as if they were written today. I share his love for Scotland and so reading this book was a little virtual holiday for me. Being a lover of poetry as well, Smith introduced me to many names of poets, writers and their works I will have to look up. Tannahill and Hugh McDonald, to name just two. Lovely book.
Maybe It's because I just spent another wonderful summer holiday in the USA (Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, not Texas), camping out rough in glorious nature, climbing mountains, walking along rivers and through deserts, spotting wildlife, learning about the wild flowers and plants and how the indigenous people used these plants to feed themselves and cure disease, that I enjoyed this book so much. I love the USA and I love the stories of her hard and brave history. To me it is amazing that a very genteel Dutch writer like Arthur Japin can turn out a book that, to my mind, touches the heart and spirit of the Wild West, making pioneers and Indians come to life. Maybe that's what a good writer can do, they can show us how in spite of our cultural differences, we are all one people. That what binds us is more and stronger than what keeps us apart. The story is based on a true story of a pioneer woman, Granny Parker, whose family was killed and some of them abducted by Comanche Indians. The story describes her life after this terrible event, her quest for revenge and her relentless journey to get her loved ones back and try to create some kind of happy future together. Of course life doesn't work out that way. Even regaining some of her relatives does not lead to happy-ever-after. We learn from this book that terrible events in the past can not be wiped away, however much you would like to. They continue to impact the present and the future. We also learn that forgiveness is not something you give when you feel your enemy deserves it. It is something you give yourself, to set yourself free from hate, pain and sorrow.
Clever little suspense novel set in the international art world. Interesting thoughts on what is art? what is art's role in society? and what is it's value to humankind? I enjoyed Zwagerman's writing.
Reading Jane Austen is always a joy! I purposefully turn to her writing when I need cheering up or reassurance that I still love reading after a particularly boring, trying or unintellible book by any other author. It is like a reset.I very much enjoyed Mansfield Park, however I did not like the end as much as some other Jane Austen novels. I was hoping for more of a plot twist, or rather a different plot twist, and more character development. Never mind. I can live with the outcome.
This book tells the story of an old woman in imperial China looking back on her life from humble beginnings as a poor village girl rising to be the wife of a rich village head by grace of her perfect bound feet. It was interesting to read about the traditional life of women in this region in south-west China and how girls are educated in the women's quarters, forbidden to men, where they learn all the skills needed to best carry out their traditional roles of daughter, wife and mother. An important part of their education is learning to read and write Nüshu, the secret women's script. The main protagonist, Lily, is bound in childhood to Snowflower in the "laotong"-system. "Laotong" hold the closest relationship and bond of love and friendship which should endure every hardship in life until death do part the two women. Through an unfortunate misunderstanding Lily almost fails her Laotong-promise to Snowflower. I was interested by the subject matter, and even though it had many sad episodes, the book did not manage to make me feel much for the characters in the story. The book is written in a fairly matter-of-fact documentary style which did not touch my heart. Too bad.
Story of two young lovers in 1930s Shanghai who are torn apart by a dramatic event. Although for both of them they are the "love of the others life", abruptly losing contact and not knowing exactly what happened they both choose a different path in life. The stifling ties of traditional Chinese family life and the complicated relations between men and women in Confucianist society, in which no one dares to express their true thoughts and feelings, make it impossible for the lovers to make a choice for their own happiness. When they finally meet again and share their life stories many years later, although they still feel their love, they realize there is no way back and calmly (and very Chinesely) accept that their love was only predestined for "half a life".
Readable short novel showing the plight of intellectuals in the late 1970's and early 1980's in the People's Republic of China. A responsible and capable eye surgeon Dr Lu Wenting sacrifices everything, neglects her husband and children and her own health to serve her patients selflessly. Until one day her constant overwork leads to a sudden heart attack. Drifting in and out of consciousness, close to death, she thinks about her life and ponders her life choices. She and her husband, a metallurgy scientist, lead a hard life giving all their time to their work, earning barely enough to support themselves and their two children. They bear the burden of responsibility not only to carry out their demanding jobs, but to go beyond the call of duty, gathering new knowledge to support the Four Modernisations Campaign aiming to enable China to catch up with the developed countries. They are middle-aged, beginning to lose their strength and stamina, but still they know what is expected of them, and they know it is too much, not humanly possible. And still they continue to try and fulfil society's expectations. Dr Lu and her husband are contrasted with Dr Jiang and her husband, both doctors, who grasp their chance to escape and start a new life abroad. Both couples are exemplary of the different choices and opinions in the topical discussion of the early 1980's about the role and position of intellectuals in mainland China. Realistic and objective depiction of their dilemmas.
I found this book enlightening about the possible and probable root causes of depression and I share many of the views of the author on what we can do to prevent or heal depression. I too believe that modern day society and lifestyle has a lot to answer for. And I am already doing my best to live like she suggests. We have a lot to gain from going back to basics and to a more natural way of life. Although I do not know how I could ever live without bread and cheese, I am willing to try to change my habits for better health. Brogan however, lost me in chapter 9 with her endless list of suggested medical testing and supplementing. I do not want to be healthy by swapping one bottle of stuff for another. Her recipes look quite good, so I will try out her diet, and cut down on sugar, grains, dairy and processed foods even more than I do now.
Very good first(?) attempt at writing a children's or young adult's fantasy adventure novel. Wonderful original inventions of the way the city of Moerasstad is built up and functions in three physically, socially and politically seperated city levels. Fantastic descriptions of the surrounding natural world. Loads of intriguing stuff is introduced in this book that deserves to be worked out in more detail. Too much of interest is merely touched upon leaving the reader wondering why it was introduced to tantalise and just left undeveloped. The writing is simple and the dialogue sometimes crude and anachronistic (the protagonists speak like teenagers of our world today and it doesn't suit them). The writing is however very film-script like. While reading I could clearly see all the wonderful background and exciting action taking place before my eyes. I think the book should be offered to a film-maker and will prove very succesful as a film-script.The authors are father (my BEd Science and Technology teacher) and daughter. How lovely it must be to write a book together!
It was a quick, fun read for someone who loves China and food. But very thin and predictable.
Collection of short stories and essays by Jan Wolkers, prominent Dutch writer of the 60's and 70's. In these stories Wolkers expresses his deep love and childlike wonderment of nature. The stories describe not the grand wildernis but the everyday nature close at hand: the beach, the dunes, the heather fields and forests, the meadows of his childhood in Oegstgeest, and his beloved backyard on the island of Texel. He writes with true love and in amazing detail about all he sees, and so makes the most insignificant bird, flower or insect worth looking at and celebrating. I love these stories.
Short philosophical essay by the Dutch philosopher Joke Hermsen on the relationship between time and the soul. Difficult reading for me. I am not half clever enough to read philosophy even though I love it and long to develop deeper thoughts of my own. This essay is written in the form of a diary kept during a short stay in the countryside in France, where the author owns an old farmhouse. (Jealous. I want an old farmhouse in France too.) The book doesn't give a definitive answer to the question what the soul actually is, but contains many strains of thought that speak to my heart. One notion I like is that we need to seek stillness, need to wait, take time, in order to reach deep thought that may offer us new and useful ideas to solve our problems or to come to new creativity. Another favourite is the poem by Wislawa Szymborska which Hermsen quotes. The poem says that the soul is not generally with us when we do everyday ordinary things, but it is always with us in moments when joy and sadness meet. Hermsen also discovers that long-distance walking in nature (on the pelgrimage route to Santiago de Compostella) is an excellent way to calm your thoughts and reach deeper insights. All good stuff for those of us trying to make sense of life, once again.
Biography of Jimi Hendrix in his own words. The layout and the whole idea of the biography are very original and creative. I enjoyed reading this book and getting to know Jimi Hendrix. Too bad he died so young.
Having just read The Wild Things by Dave Eggers, I had to reread this picture book on which that novel is based. It's a good picture book, it tells a fairly complex story with strong images and very few words. A little boy Max, dressed in his wolf-suit, lashes out like a wild thing and gets punished by his mother and sent to his room without dinner. There he has a dream adventure of sailing away to a strange island where the wild things, a group of large loud monsters live. Max becomes their king and orders them to have a loud wild party. At some point however, he suddenly feels lonely and out of place. He has enough of being king and partying with these strange beasts. He feels longs for his loved ones, his dinner and his home. He leaves even though the monsters don't want him to go. He returns to his room, where his dinner is waiting. "There's no place like home" is the moral of the story.
I love birds. All birds. Even the common everyday birds I see in my suburban area, such as the coot (meerkoet in Dutch). The book tells about the life and times of the coot and how these birds manage to be successful all over the world. No small feat for a bird you rarely see flying (they do it at night). The book is a comfortable mix of scientific fact, popular science and pleasing humorous prose written with knowledge and love. Very enjoyable reading and much to learn about the coot. The most interesting thing is how the coot adapts to the unique living environment it happens to find itself in. So in a small country like Holland you can see very different coot behaviour in coots living quite near to each other but in different habitats: inner city, suburban area's, vast open water area's etc.. Coots are very flexible resourceful survivors. I started reading this book at the very end of winter, beginning of spring, perfect timing to start to observe the coots in my area. I have already identified the Corner pond coots, the Broekmolensloot coots, the Boezemwater coots and the Golf course coots... I'll be watching them.
Van Gulik's Judge Dee stories are wonderful. The stories were for many Sinologists of my generation the reason they were drawn to study Chinese. This little book was very enjoyable. Baffling goings on, expertly detected and unravelled by the excellent Judge Dee and his men.
I decided to read this book because of the previous book I read "Don't sweat the small stuff"advising me to once in a while read a book by someone with ideas you totally disagree with... The argument being that you might learn something from an unexpected angle. Trump was an obvious choice for me of someone I totally disagree with. Funnily enough the book was similarly set up as "Don't sweat..": short punchy topical chapters with advice, now not on how to lead a happy life, but on how to get rich. Some of the advice that rang home was actually the same Like: be an early riser. I also liked his advice on how to be a good speaker. And I also appreciated the fact that Trump judges people and gives them chances based on their talent rather than their degrees or worth on paper. I might page through the book again when I need some advice on my buisness. Most of the book however was very remote from my reality and my interest. I found the name-dropping and the patting himself on the back a bit tedious, but them maybe I should be working a bit more on my ego....
Lovely little book. True record of the seven years the little sparrow Timmy, spent living with the author Clare Kipps. She became known after her first book Sold for a Farthing, which tells the story of her first live-in companion sparrow Clarence. Timmy differs from Clarence in that he was first brought up in the wild by his sparrow parents, Clarence having never known his biological parents. The book is very sweet, there is much love and amazing action, communication and understanding between woman and bird. A bird-lovers book.
I enjoyed this book. It describes the life and generational problems of two sisters and a brother in a middle class Indian family. The first part of the book follows Uma the old maid elder sister in the family. Not pretty, not smart and kept very short by her parents. She is allowed no life of her own at all. She lives in service to her parents. The second part follows Arun, the only son in the family. His whole life was aimed at his education, nothing but study, study study to allow him to go to university in the US. Once there he is unable to relate to American culture and leads a totally lonely and alienated life. I liked the first half of the book, which taakes place in India better than the second half staged in the US. Somehow it seems easier to take interest in the troubles of individuals in another cultural setting than in our own.
Jane Austen is my favourite author. Reading any of her books really gives you the pleasure of being totally in a different time and place with people you get to know and love or dislike as the case may be. Emma is indeed a girl, as Jane Austen intended, who has her faults and may not be instantly totally likeable. But the way she sees her mistakes and weaknesses, and the true mortification she feels at them, and the way she tries to remedy the problems she has created is quite touching and redeeming. I love her relief when sometimes problems solve themselves. Ultimately I like Emma and wish her well. I would love a Mr Knightley for myself.
Lovely little novel about the life of two young Chinese "intellectuals" sent to a remote mountain village for political "re-education" during the Cultural Revolution. Life is hard and almost unbearable until they get their hands on a book by Balzac in Chinese translation. Balzac also offers them a way towards the love and friendship of a beautiful mountain girl. The power of literature changes all of their lives. Beautifully written, lovely book, touched my heart, choked up at the end... Really liked it. For a change also a realistic, but lighter more humorous depiction of life during the Cultural Revolution. Now I really finding myself really needing to read some Balzac, which I have never yet read...
Collection of columns by Annemarie Haverkamp, previously published in the Gelderlander newspaper. Annemarie started these columns during her pregnancy, which happened to be concurrent with that of Princess Màxima. Màxima gave birth to the healthy baby Amalia, Annemarie's baby Job, unfortunately was born with a serious chromosome fault causing many physical and mental difficiencies. With love, humor and honesty Annemarie describes how she and her husband respond to the arrival of Job in their lives, the many problems they encounter and solve or learn to live with. I have a lot of respect for their strength, courage and love.
Enjoyable childhood and youth memoire of a miner's daughter from the Forest of Dean.
Disturbing short novel about what happens to the cleaners and moderators who monitor content on social media. It's happening to us all.
Short idyllic novel about the last evening and night of a biology students' field trip to a natural peat bog area. The natural world and surroundings are idyllic and beautifully described ('t Hart is a biologist), but there is also a sense of tragedy. It's a love story with a lot of conjecture and misunderstanding, typical of youth, but also seriously impossible because of secrets revealed. The blurb on the back of the book suggests the story is an internalised version of the history of Romeo and Juliet. I agree it has that feel.
The main character Rebecca suddenly feels that she has turned into the wrong person, not the person she was supposed to be. She muses abut her life and tries to pick up her old life where the clear line of destiny seemed to break off when she suddenly dropped out of college, left her childhood sweetheart and married an older man with three kids who runs a party center for a living. She goes far in trying, picking up her university research topic and trying to reconnect with her old love. Is it possible to retrace your steps and pick up where you left off to become the "real" you that you were meant to be?Interesting thought, nicely worked out.
I love this series of books about birds. The Black Woodpecker this time Enjoyable to read and very educational!
Really liked this book. Captivating story and characters. I see why people call Donna Tartt's work Dickensian. Makes me want to read more Dickens. Wonderful characters: I love Hobie and Boris.Story of a young boy, Theo Decker, who survives a horrific museum-bombing that kills his mother who is everything to him. Alone and lost, like a Dickensian orphan, he drifts through life holding on to the painting he acquires at the time of the bombing. The painting takes his mother's place in life because of it's beauty, it's permanence and the way it reminds him of her. For better or for worse, the painting guides his life, bringing him in touch with an array of very diverse people, leading him into the antiques and art world, and ultimately into the criminal world. Interesting questions: should you follow your heart if you know your heart is leading you to disaster? And can good come from choosing bad?
Sweet memory of memorable childhood reading. I never realized it was written by William Faulkner, his only work for children, and that it is now a quite sought after rare item...It is the story of the dream experience of young Dulcie and an assortment of companions searching for the Wishing Tree on the eve of her birthday. The moral of the story, taught by St Francis who appears in the dream experience, is that if you are kind to helpless things, you do not need a Wishing Tree to make things come true.
This short novel is rich in Chinese cultural content. It tells the story of a brilliant opera singer whose career was cut short by an unfortunate action of her own doing. When many years later she gets a rare chance to star again in HER opera as the Moon Goddess Chang E, she works herself into a state of the utmost ambitious frenzy. Grueling hard work, all-consuming dedication, neglect of family life, professional jealousy, physical suffering. The price of stardom and succes is perhaps too high...I enjoyed reading this novel. Convincing characters with recognizable human failings.
I have enjoyed other writings by Anaïs Nin, this one I have mixed feelings about. A bit too much poetic description and embellishment, which at times was distracting from the story or unintelliable to me (even though I love poetry). Some stories I did connect with. Maybe I lacked the concentration needed to enjoy this book at this time.
Interesting book. I'm a sinologist and lived in China for 8 years, so I know about the Tiger Mother concept. Before reading this book I was a fan of Amy Chua, based on her book about the rise and fall of empires. Her portrait of herself as a mother in this book makes it very difficult for me to understand or like her. I found her very show-offy, snobbish and self-centered. I hope Chua's Tiger mother parenting has not damaged her daughters for good. Sometimes the damage only shows later in life.Book was well written and the stort very interesting.
I decided to read this book after I learned that it was partly inspired by Billy Bragg's song St Swithin's Day (which I love). The book follows the lives of Dexter and Emma who get together on their graduation day from Edinburgh University. They remain close friends even though their lives take very different paths.The book follows their lives and changing circumstances on St Swithin's Day every year after graduation. Their friendship endures, changes and grows and seems predestined for more. I enjoyed reading this book, especially the first half, because it depicts young people's life in Britain exactly like I experienced it in the late 1980's when I lived in Newcastle for a while. The book is very light reading and the characters are likeable enough (althugh not immensely). I was just thinking I didn't think much of the book when the ending hit me and managed to move me. It left me feeling that although life is pretty pointless really, but there are meetings between people and moments full of love and beauty, meaning and importance that make life worth living. The trick is to experience them to the full and cherish them. Because these meetings and moments are hard to recognise at the moment itself, make sure you savour every moment you feel happy.
I like Siebelink. I like the settings of his work: the religious gardener's background, the difficult and frustrating work and life of teachers in the Netherlands, literature and literary research, and themes such as friendship and stubbornly remaining true to your convcitions. This little book has it all, and it was a pleasure to read. A teacher from a religious gardener's background struggling with personal grief, the sudden disappearance of his father in his childhood, and the loss of his own child, keeps himself busy with a PhD research project and writing a novel. He befriends two very different writers who support and try to guide him in completing his book. In this story he reflects on the course of his life, loves and friendships, in the last moments of his life.
I had to look up the meaning of the title of this book to get a better understanding of it. "Cakes and Ale" comes from a quote from Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, indicating the hedonistic good life. Somerset Maugham describes the "good life" of the respected writer Ted Driffield in his younger years when he lived with his first wife Rosie, a barmaid. Trying to write the perfect biography of her husband, the second Mrs Driffield employs a writer Kear for this task, but she wants to eliminate anything improper from his life story, mainly anything about the free and hedonistic life he led when he was married to Rosie. The "I" narrator of the book, Ashenden, knew Driffield and Rosie from when he was a boy in Blackstable and a young man in London. In London he shared and enjoyed the couple's carefree bohemian lifestyle. Where Kear and the second wife wish to gloss over this period of the writer's life and especially put down and ridicule the simple Rosie, Ashenden remembers her as lovely and lovind, natural and free, a true artist's muse. The book puts the snobbery of the English literary circle to shame. Apparently the book was based on real life characters and caused a stir and damage to reputations in the day. I liked the book. Rosie is a memorable character. I wonder if this book inspired The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion?
This is a disappointing book. It was written in the 1950's and not published formally until quite recently. The published book is still very much a draft with many spelling and grammatical mistakes in the text and numerous typo's. This makes the book uncomfortsble to read. I travel regularly to St Eustatius and love the island, it;s people and history. This interest makes the book worth reading for me personally. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the daily life of the traders, seamen and plantation holders and their families. The role St Eustatius played in the Ameriacan war of independence is fascinating and deserves more recognition. However, the plot and the storylines are not fully developed in the book. Towards the end of the book little more remains than a hurried sketchy description of historical events, interesting in themselves, but not developed and integrated into the novel.A pity. I was glad wgen I had finished the book and could start reading something else. Sorry... Still I'm keen to read more Caribbean literature and am open to recommendations.
The blurb on the back of the book promised a story about the clash between religious fanaticism and "freedoms". The question asked: Are we defending our freedoms or defending our emptiness? The blurb drew me to reading the book because people near and dear to me are struggling with these topical questions and concepts.The book moves me to thinking the latter: we are defending our emptiness, and we know it. But we like to forget. And so we drink and take drugs and have meaningless social contacts and meaningless sex. The book takes you on a pub crawl with Dimitri Verhulst to a number of cafés and clubs in a Belgian town. You actually feel you are there with him, and you are inside his head, following his thoughts, feelings and his decisions as he lets himself go all evening and into the next day, even against his better judgement. To me it has no pull, has no charm. It is all empty. And the fact that Europe is burning, another Muslim terrorist attack, is just water off a ducks back. It has no impact. Just emptiness. Let's have another gin and tonic, a line of coke, a snog with a stranger... I didn't like the book, but maybe because it disturbed me, I'll give it three stars...Verhulst's writing is excellent. I love his language. However, this book was a little difficult to read because the layout of text has no paragraphs. Effect very stream-of-consciousness, and I am sure that is what he wanted to achieve.
Humorous little book making fun of all the stereotypes about Scotland, its history and its culture. I did not laugh a lot, but then my loved ones say I have no sense of humour.
Story of the hard and tragic life of an old Chinese farm labourer. Very recognizable tragic story, well-told, never sentimental, still made me cry. And that is unusual for Chinese literature.
Short stories by St Martin author Lasana M Sekou. I always like to read something local when I am abroad. It helps to feel and understand the new place you are in. It adds to the experience. Could not find any St Eustatius literature, so St martin literature is the next best thing. I love Sekou's use of local language. It is realistic an poetic at the same time. The theme of these stories is love. All kinds of different kinds of love. You feel the love in the stories, even though the situations described are hard and sometimes far from loving. I liked the book a lot. It also gave an insight in the political and societal problems of St Martin.
Written as a chapter explaining the ancestry of the hero of Annejet's book Sonny Boy. Discarded from the final manuscript but well worth reading on it's own. It tells in a factual and unbiassed way of the ups and downs of planters, slave owners and slaves in colonial Surinam. Interesting.
Excellent book. I agree with Dr Joanna Rummens in her introduction to this book, and I borrow heavily from her insights in my review (couldn't say it any better). It is a book "full of spellbinding poetic narratives, compelling, beautifully and powerfully written, rich in fertile imagery, symbolic allusions..., 'national" reference and socio-political commentary. The language is amazing, you can tell that Sekou is a poet, bringing to so vividly to life in his prose the "hypnotic rhythms and richly hued tapestry of Caribbean life."These four short stories vividly depict past, present and future struggles, "suffering and sacrifice, courage and resilience" of the people of St Martin, from the olden times of slavery through to an imaginary future. As in the other book I read by Sekou, "Love songs make you cry", "human relationships and the redeeming and healing power of love, patience and forgiveness, commitment to family and country are celebrated in these stories".'The Salting', a story about how an young girl , an African princess, is robbed and taken into slavery to St Martin, makes you cry and almost physically experience the cruelty of the slave trade.'The Wake', tells a secret family story, showing male-female relations and the psychology of the effects of a violent event on the lives of those concerned. Love, patience and forgiveness win, heal and redeem all.'Brotherhood of Spurs'describes the culture of cockfighting in St Martin. The story is full of symbolism of struggle, love and ties which unite.'Firespill' is a futuristic political commentary about the fulfillment of the St Martin dream of unification, in a high-tech sci-fi global-world setting.Now I want to read Sekou's poetry.
I really liked this book. Over the past 12 years I spent quite a bit of time in Almere, getting to know the place, but never feeling at home there, never coming to like the place. The newness and purpose-made quality of this new town did not appeal to me, I prefer history and tradition around me for a satisfying sense of place, to feel the continuity and meaning of life. However, Almere became an important place in my life. Hearing about Renate Dorrestein's novel about the world coming to an end with only Almere remaining, I had to read it. The apocalyptic story is gripping, well-written, with appealing characters. The book contains many imaginative possibilities about how society may disintegrate, reform and develop after disaster strikes. No spoilers. I can recommend this book to everyone.
I am always really pleasantly surprised when books written long ago feel so timeless and relevant today. First published in 1926, the book takes the form of a diary kept by a primary school teacher working at an "armenschool", a school for the poor in turn-of the-century Netherlands. Just like schoolteachers today he complains of incomprehensible adminstrative duties and ridiculous government educational measures, he struggles with classroom management and wonders at the strength and resilience of the children in his class. In recording the simple day-to-day events in his classroom he gives them the importance and value they deserve. A loving and trusting relationship between teacher and class is a precious thing for all. His conclusion is that all that matters is that he and the children entrusted to his care form a "happy class" for the time they are together. All the rest is nonsense. All teachers should read this book. It lifts your heart, strengthens your purpose and gives you courage.
I am a great fan of Amy Tan's books. This was my least favourite and took quite a bit of effort to read. The book intentionally mixes storylines and locations in the US and China, in past and present, in the real world and the Yin world, the world of ghosts, causing the protagonist Olivia and the reader to become unsure about what is what, when is when and who is who, what is real and what not. I suppose clever in a way, but not an easy read. The historical background was hard to follow, even for a Sinologist, as myself, with knowledge of the Opium wars, Taiping Rebellion and other historical events of the time. I don't know what a reader with no or limited knowledge of Chinese history would make of it. I found the language of the book also less attractive: Chinglish, Proper English and very vernacular American English (which I hate), all emphasized, I suppose to distinguish the various changing focal points in the different chapters.The story was interesting enough. The book describes half Chinese Olivia's life in the US with an unwanted secret older sister who joins her family from China after the death of their father. Kwan can communicate with ghosts and seems to be on a mission to fulfil a promise made in another life. A trip to China turns childhood stories into a reality encompassing past and present, bringing insight to Olivia about life, love, friendship and loyalty.
After reading Wolf Hall I had to read this one to know what happened next. Poor Anne... Although I didn't much like her, I think she got a rough deal. This book was easier to read than Wolf Hall, but also less literary, more journalistic, to my mind. I grew to like the character of Thomas Cromwell in the first book. But that feeling didn't grow in this book.Still, I want to know what happens next with Jane Seymour...
Small booklet of poetry by almost forgotten Dutch poet Lévi Weemoedt, selected and revived by trendy Dutch writer Özcan Akyol. The titel of this book is "Pessimism can be learned!" and all the poems reflect the author's pessimistic view of and disappointment with life. Dutch people love this kind of poetry. It makes them laugh. Weemoedt's recitals are like stand-up comedy. I like his poems too, they ring true, but they don't make me laugh. They move me, sometimes to tears. My children say I have no sense of humour.
This novel is based on the children's picture book Where the Wild Things are by Maurice Sendak. The book tells of the dreamlike adventures of a small boy Max who runs away from home, wearing his wolf-suit, after being punished by his mother for a wild frustration temper tantrum. Max' life is complicated and uncertain. His father has left the family after the parents' divorce, his mother is distracted and has to work hard to make ends meet, and she has a new boyfriend too, his sister has outgrown him as a friend and companion. He doesn't get the attention he needs and reacts by wild unacceptable behaviour. Max runs away, finds a boat and sails away to a strange island where the wild things live. He becomes their king. He wants to make them happy and thinks up all kinds of plans to do so, but is met by irrational behaviour, which he recognises in himself. Trying to deal with the wild things' irrationality, teaches him important lessons about his own behaviour. By the time he decides to leave the island and return home he has grown and has learnt some important lessons in life. The book was ok. I liked the way Max was confronted by the wild things' childishness, selfishness, violence, and how it made him recognise his own shortcomings.
Very surprising an unusual real life historic love story of a young Dutchman setting up a trading business in Charleston, South Carolina in the early 1800's and a young slave girl who nurses him back to health from a fever attack. He fell in love, secretly bought her freedom, married her and together they had a happy family with many children. This secret life was hard to keep in Charleston where slavery was the mainstay of economic life and strict laws where kept to keep the status quo between white people and coloured people. SPOILER ALERT: When things start to turn after slave uprisings and unrest, the family are secretly moved one by one to the Netherlands where they live happily for some time. Death and grief, broken hearts cause the happiness to crumble, but the love story is treasured and shared in the family to this day.
In 1845 Henry David Thoreau went to live by himself in the woods by the shores of Walden pond in Massachusetts. He stayed there for two years living self-sufficiently in a small cabin he built all by himself. In this book he writes about his experience and shows us that all the beauty and fulfilment of life can be found in nature and a very basic and simple life. In this book Thoreau also expresses his philosophical and political views and motivations for wanting to leave society and the prevailing materialist way of life that was prevalent in his day and remains so in ours. I found many of his views to still very much ring true today. I too would like to lead a simple life in the wilderness. Thoreau tells us and demonstrates it is possible and worthwhile. I will have to reread this book sometime, I found the language deceptively difficult to follow at times.
Poetic theater script. Modern day version of Sophocles drama Antigone set in the troubled multicultural Molenbeek district of Brussels. The modern Antigone is Nouria, a bright law student with a Muslim immigrant background living in Brussels. Just like the original Antigone Nouria desperately seeks the right to bury her slain brother, a Muslim extremist suicide bomber, who blew himself up in a bloody terrorist attack. The book is a plea for the need for compassion and fellow humanity. Maybe even a suicide bomber's family deserves the right to grieve for and bury their dead loved ones properly. Just like Antigone before her, Nouria's failed and frustrated quest leads to her self-chosen death in police custody.
Young girl's story about a hot and (at first) very happy summer in the south of France in which she develops a cunning plan to avert the danger of losing the life she knows and loves, with her bon vivant father. When the elegant and very grown-up Anne joins her father, his young mistress of the moment Elsa and the protagonist daughter Cécile, everything in their happy-go-lucky life changes. Anne monopolizes and influences the father, chases away the young mistress, and criticizes and forbids Cécile to pursue her budding first love with the nice young neighbour Cyril. The future of gaining such a perfect wife and a mother is frightening to Cécile. She thinks up and carries out her masterplan. Will the plan be successful? and will Cécile (and her father) be happy with the result?I enjoyed the book, it describes a good picture of adolescent jealousy and conniving to get things in life their own way. You can't always get what you want, and sometimes when you get it, you find you don't want what you think you wanted. First time I read a book in French in more than forty years. I can still do it! I am sure I missed many nuances of the language, but I could follow and enjoy the story. I must practice and read more in the foreign languages I have learned.
Dystopian shocking classic coming of age novel. It's about how it's difficult and scary to be young, dealing with your own independence and wishes in life and what society wants and expects of you. It shows frighteningly how society can brainwash you one way or the other and even the strongest willed person may succombe. I have to think about what I think of the ending of the book and what it means.
I liked the title. I liked the idea of magical thinking as a coping strategy after a loss or bereavement. There was some, but not much magical thinking in this book. Everyone grieves, mourns and lives on in their own way and in their own time, but one does like to find resonance, beauty and meaning in the words and actions of others. Didion had a lot to cope with, her husband dying suddenly at the same time as her only daughter lay fighting for her life in hospital. In the book she follows her own struggle to understand her loss and try to continue living. I found her way fairly clinical, hard, fact-seeking. Didion thinks back a lot on her and her husbands very pleasant life together. But at the same time she tries to avoid going places or thinking thoughts that will take her back. I did not understand why she would be afraid of memories. My departed loved ones are still very much alive to me, mainly due to memories and magical thinking. One year is not enough.
I was prejudiced about this book before reading it, sure I would not like it. The subject matter did not appeal to me and I do not like the public persona of writer Arnon Grunberg. However, I enjoyed the book. Even though the story was strange and absurd and the characters exaggerated,I found a lot of truths in the book I could relate to and need to write down to remember.For me the story shows how 'alone' we all really are in this life, all of us asylum seekers in life. The tragedy is that we all NEED and search for meaning and love and meaningful others in life even if we spend a lifetime kidding ourselves that we don't.
I am trying to understand what is happening in Ukraine and why Russia has started the current war and what the explanations, on all sides, can be for this sad situation. Other people may reach for a history book, online information or newspapers to try and understand. For me reading literature helps me to see the impossible complexity and to empathize and feel the different truths and the pain of all involved. The book is very well written and I am charmed by the descriptions of Ukrainian culture and traditions and the deep love of family and homeland.Aleksandra is a sad family history, written by Ukrainian-Dutch writer Lisa Weeda. The fluke of fate that took Aleksandra, Weeda's maternal grandmother, to the Netherlands, really brings the story (too close for comfort) home to the Dutch reader. I learned a lot I didn't know. I cried too.
This book was given to me as a Christmas present from the director of the school I work at. It was not a book I would have chosen myself, but it is good to be pushed out of your comfort zone of books of your preference from time to time. I read mostly for pleasure, for beauty and comfort, and this book did not offer any of this. It was a raw story of people in a bad neighbourhood of Rotterdam struggling to survive from day to day. Mostly young, but also old, multiculturals, misfits (or at least they perceive themselves to be). The book touches on practically all present day social problems and issues: poverty, racism, misunderstanding and hatred between different religions and cultures, loneliness, old people struggling to find their place and value in society, dementia, the jewish problem (past and present), muslim radicalism, social security, invalidity, unemployment, violence, child abuse, rape. Maybe a too many themes to make a strong point. Despite the grey subject matter, the book ends on a hopeful note. Hard work and belief in oneself can lead to miracles.Just like the old man in the novel I turn to nature, and especially birds, for solace. I see the kingfisher from time to time during my walks, and I know birds do help.
Best Chinese novel I've read for a long time. Disturbing but highly recognizable to me who spent 8 years of my life in the 80's and 90's and regular visits in this century) in the China of this novel. The book depicts the marked changes in the lives of different generations, with in the backdrop the dark influences of the troubled times of the parents from which the children can not escape. Well written and excellent translation.
Most enjoyable book I have read in a long time.I loved the character of the Lady Detective Precious Ramotswe. The stories are simple but captivating nevertheless. Alexander McCall writes with love about Africa and African people and their culture. The book made me curious to learn more about Africa and to explore 'proper' African literature. The edition I read, craftily included the first chapter of the second book in the Precious Ramotswe series... I'm afraid I'm hooked and I'll have to find me a copy of Tears of the Giraffe soon. Can't wait to find out what will happen next...
I love Fitzgerald's writing style. His picture of rich American's in 1920's Europe is very vivid and compelling. Too much money and too much leisure are bad for you.
Thank God for lovely very short books. Thanks to this one I actually met my book challenge for 2015 and had a lovely little enjoyable read. Tellegen's books often are fable-like very short stories featuring animals. The stories however show strong psychological insight into the emotions and weaknesses of human beings. This book, a birthday present, was about how difficult birthday celebrations actually are. How do you feel about your birthday, do you experience stress about how to celebrate, who to invite? Are you lonely on your birthday or loved? Or do you only feel lonely and unloved and actually fail to see all the love around you? Lovely, lovely litle book. I think I will read it every year around birthday time.
Very interesting story of one English gentleman's quest to promote the beautiful Japanese flowering Cherry trees in Britain and around the world, cultivating and protecting a large variety of trees, saving these rarer species from extinction in their homeland Japan. The book also tells the history of cherry trees in Japan, providing information about the cultural and political role of the tree and it's flowers in Japanese history and culture. Very interesting.
Very Chinese basic introduction to the principles and practices of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). I found the book not very logically structured and at times going off into too much in my view unnecessary detail to achieve it's purpose to provide a beginners understanding of TCM. Translation sometimes very murky. Lovely little book, though, with nice illustrations. It did enough to further my interest into TCM. Must find a better book now.
This novel takes place in Beijing during the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square student uprising which ended on the 4th of June 1989 when the Chinese government sent in armed soldiers and tanks to clear the square and the streets with force. Students who took part in the uprising have to scatter and hide as they are hunted down to be punished by the authorities. The main protagonist is a young poetess, Lin Ying, who took part in the uprising and now is deeply affected by the crack down and return to conservatism and repression. As I myself was a foreign student studying in China during the early and mid 1980's the subject matter is of great interest to me and close to my heart. The setting in circles of young writers, poets, musicians and artists is promising. Unfortunately, the book does not deliver. The book is a mish-mash of styles ranging from a trashy student love story to an attempt at political critique, but for me it fails on all fronts. I liked the first chapter where Lin Ying finds herself shocked and lost in the midst of destruction after the flush-out of the demonstration, but in the following chapters I found the story very contrived, trying far to hard to attack political and moral taboos. The blurb on the back of the book calls it a sexual Bildungsroman depicting Lin Ying's search for freedom and individuality in trying times. This sounds promising, however, I was not impressed and never moved by her quest. The sexy bits were not sexy. Much of the philosophical thought put forward by the characters in the book was obtuse and again, did not move me. Am I being too hard?
This book contains a selection of blogposts by China's (then) most popular blogger Han Han written and posted between 2008 and 2012. Han Han is a controversial popular cult figure: racing car driver, pop singer, novelist and magazine editor. He is most famous for his personal blog in which he comments on Chinese contemporary society and reacts critically to a variety of themes and current events. Han Han criticises China's educational system, officialdom, corruption, inequality, censorship, and nationalism. His blogposts are clever, humorous and often sarcastic.I was eager to read this book because I had heard a lot about Han Han and his blogs. I enjoyed reading the early blogs at the beginning of the book. I know China well and recognise the problematic issues he writes about. I admire his honesty and daring to voice his feelings and views on various controversial subjects. Towards the end of the book however, I lost interest, it all seemed just more of the same harping on about things. A repetitious political view, and trying to hard to be clever. I missed real personal sentiment, and some less political writing.The book does gives an interesting insight into the state of affairs in China of the period 2008-2012, from a different point of view. It may be difficult to follow for readers who do not know China well. May be interesting for people studying Contemporary China.
Enjoyed this book very much. I always like reading a book which takes place in the place I am at that moment. So a Caribbean book for the Caribbean.Although this book is "old" a lot of the happenings described are extremely recognizable even today. I liked the characters and the action was quite gripping, making you want to find out what was going to happen next, and how things would end. Lots of surprising action at the end of the book...
I read this book for a number of reasons. First of all I knew Justin Hill when he was a very young VSO volunteer English teacher in China. I was the Field Officer responsible for the volunteers in Shanxi, the province where Justin was sent to teach. Tall, handsome, blond curls, very young, but then already deeply interested in the world around him and serious about it. His life since then has obviously been an adventure and he has become a very good writer.Second reason for reading this book was that in the past year I was working in a schoolclass at a primary school in Holland especially for children from around the world who have come to live in Holland. They all come to this class to learn Dutch before moving on to regular schoolclasses. It's a lovely mix of children from all over the world: among others well-off kids with highly educated parents from Brazil, South Africa, Japan, Iran, children of illiterate Chinese restaurant cooks, Syrian refugees, and children from Eritrea. I realized I knew nothing about Eritrea. So I picked up this book.Justin Hill writes very well. Some scenes are excellent. The encounter with the young prostitute, being chased by a crazed guy with his pants round his ankles, slaughtering a goat... Reading his stories of Eritrea, I was there, and I could relate to the people. I recognised the sharp, quick, hard (don't know how to describe it) beauty of the people, I recognise it in the Eritrean children I know here in Holland. I found the history complex and hard to understand and to follow what happened and why, but maybe that's the point. Their wars and fighting seem pointless, purely destructive, but at the same time, their only real raison d' être. I will have to look up some more recent history to understand why the children I know are here now, and how come they could still spend their summer holidays back in Eritrea. Eyes shining on their return with memories of their beloved country.
Dutch book for parents and educators explaining how our conventional methods and notions of child-rearing are detrimental to the childs true inner self. Well written and convincing. We are bringing up our children in a way which hampers their happiness and personal growth. It's not our fault, we do it because of the way we were brought up ourselves. The book is quite practical and offers different perspectives and ways to make a start at a new perspective on bringing up your children. The crucial four steps are: look-recognise-trust and let go. I liked it.
I didn't think I liked this type of fantasy book. I started reading The Hobbit after seeing the first Hobbit movie. Actually I loved it and will probably be moving on to the Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit is a lovely character. I would like to be a Hobbit.
I love Ree Drummond's website The Pioneer Woman, especially the recipes. The food is very American, sometimes with a flexitarian twist. I also regularly take part in her give-aways, hoping to win a pair of amazing cowboy boots impossible to find in the Netherlands. I think I may be her number 1 fan in the Netherlands. So when I came across her biographical novel it was a must-read. I liked bits of it, the love story with Marlboro Man is quite romantic. The metamorphosis from a Californian yuppy girl to a hard working farmer's wife is interesting. However, somehow I like Ree less after reading her book. I didn't like all the vomiting and sweating and complaining. I think she is a happy woman and should have recognized it sooner. The book goes through the courtship with Marlboro Man and first year of the marriage and ends at the birth of her first child. I am interested to know when and how Ree started with her briljant online blogshop. Is there a sequel? Sorry I didn't read the book in English. The Dutch translation was poor.
I love reading short stories, they are something in between novels and poetry. I really don't like Matthijs van Nieuwkerk, he is a poser. However, some of the stories in his selection were excellent and really moved me.
Good sound poetry, but I was not moved by most of the poems. I prefer more personal and less intellectual poetry.
Good captivating read, not only for young adults. Very realistic portrayal of what it might be like to be a teenager in the middle of a school shooting. The characters and their thoughts and feelings in the midst of the horror around them are believable. Well written, and because of the subject matter, a real page-turner.
I'm probably the only person I know who had not yet read this book. I really love Hemingway's writing. He keeps your attention from the start and there is so much feeling. I love books that make me interested in subjects I never thought I could be interested in, like deep sea fishing. The old man's desperate struggle to catch and keep a fish that would help him restore his reputation as a champion fisherman is very moving. As is the love, respect and devotion of the young boy for this old man. A book written with awe and respect for the natural world and the people living in harmony with, and humility for their natural surroundings. "Man is not much besides the great birds and beasts." A hard and lovely book.
Life is too short for me to read this kind of book... Verhoef is a very well-known author in the Netherlands, winner of prizes for suspense novels. Story clever enough, but totally forgettable. There is a big difference between "lectuur" en "literatuur". Still that's what happens when you reach for a short easy book to catch up on your reading challenge... The only thing I liked was the description of the psychologist's office, a beige coloured renovated former garage, looking out onto a Japanese style garden. Exactly like the office of a psychologist I knew... Made me laugh.
Coming of age novel tells the story of a crippled boy in a Dutch provincial village. True friendship, despite his handicaps, with the attractive creative free spirit who calls himself Joe Speedboat, and a band of other local friends, including the girl PJ, object of his silent love, lead him to unexpected adventures and acceptance of and confidence in himself.The book is amusing and touching. The descriptions about the boys' friendships and adventures are stronger than the latter part which focusses on the girl PJ, and male-female relationships.
Short novel about how unspoken and unshared grief ruins a couple's life. The plot went a bit too fast for me, too much going on in too few pages, some of it a bit cliché. And I want to know what happened to the gardner...
Real life story of Calum MacLeod, a crofter from the remote Scottish island of Raasay, who single-handedly built a road connecting his village in the north of the island to the south in an attempt to stop the neglect and decline of the community and culture he loved and wished to preserve. Amazing what sense of purpose, determination and perseverance can achieve. Respect! I love Scotland, especially the Islands.
I did not like this book. Disappointed because I really enjoyed Brick Lane. I was attracted to this book because of it's multicultural dimensions (and the setting in a restaurant kitchen). However, the book didn't ring true and didn't move me. It just didn't come to life for me. None of the characters stuck with me, not as persons or because of their cultures. The textile industry bits did not really contribute to the story. I found the book boring, repetitive and contrived. No.
Lovely book. The book follows the love story of a man and a woman from the first kiss to the heartache of decline and end of the relationship. While telling the story Alain de Botton offers philosophical explanations and insight into the emotions and behaviour of lovers in all stages of love. Joy of recognition. Lots of great quotable lines.
Like Milan/zzz in his/her review of this book, I too have mixed feelings about these short stories. The stories are mainly about people, like Li herself, trying to escape from China or aspects of Chinese tradition, culture and history. They are quite good, but the anti-communist attitude in the stories is a little too much for me. It seems to me that Yiyun Li is indeed writing (in English) what she thinks her American audience wishes to read; that China and Communism are terrible and that there is nothing good to be found there. This was particularly the case in the additional essay at the back of the book, About the Book: What has this to do with me? I am not unaware of, or blind to the horrors and tragedy of China's history, but Li's one-sided negative approach make the stories less convincing than they might have been. I know and love China, in spite of it's troubled past. A more nuanced balance of love and hate in these stories would move the reader more.
Semi-autobiographical novel describing the experience and feelings of a man during the final year of life with his terminally ill wife. Lots of down-to-earth sadness, human feeling, exasperation and also humour, recognizeable to everyone who has lost a loved one. This book was special to me because I know the author and was a fellow student in the Nature education course the main prtagonist is taking in the novel. I love how the descriptions of nature, the birds, the plants, the weather are a source of happiness and consolation in this book (as they are always to me). This is a book about dealing with unexpected (even though we all know we will die) loss. It tells us that we all come to this sooner or later. Luckily, I know that the man in the story was not condemned to solitary bicycle trips and walks in Twente as he imagines, but that in real life he found new love, happiness and companionship in that Nature education course.
I decided to read this book because two Dutch teenagers in my family really liked it and could add it to their school reading list for Dutch literature. I didn't like it, but it was OK. The book describes the, in my opinion, wasted life of an intelligent Dutch youth of Turkish descent. Although he is smart enough to be able to go on to higher education, society assumes at the age of twelve that he will come to nothing, and so send him on to schooling far below his capacity. The inevitable boredom and bad friends set him on a path leading to drink, women, fraud and eventually criminality. The character Eus just barely manages to remain a tiny bit sympathetic, mainly because of his love for his mother and his staunch and unusual friendships. The book gives a rare insight into the life of a group of Turkish-Dutch youths. A worrying picture of trouble and waste, that Dutch society doesn't seem to know or care about. The position of the girls and women in the book is really deplorable. Still the brilliant final sentence of the book redeemed "Eus" from becoming my first one-star book review. This line turned the whole reading experience on it's head, revealing to me the true hero of the book.
Interesting novel following the lives of three families with three different cultures (British-Jewish, Bangladeshi and Jamaican) over three generations in London. Unlikely connections, friendships, events and loves bring these families together, culminating in an unexpected violent apotheosis that brings past, present and future to a head. Very cleverly done. I am glad the author tells us quickly what happens to the various characters after the end of the book. Because after following them throughout, you actually wonder and care.
Delightful Dutch children's book about birds written by Camilla Dreef a young biologist and TV birdwatcher. In about forty stories she shares a lot of information about various bird's appearance, behaviour, and trekking habits. Lovely illustrations. Following her recommendation about where to spot the Black woodpecker, we actually saw one right up close during a walk in the woods. Amazing! I love birds.
Interesting, well-written book. I liked the structure of the book, each chapter focussing on a life-changing family event. I had to get used to the style of writing. It's as if someone is talking to you, telling the story. I settled into that style fairly quickly and found it enjoyable. The story is sad and depressing. It gives an interesting view of life in South Africa amidst the turmoil and changes in society in recent history. Sad and depressing.
Excellent book that explains to the lay person how the natural development of the teenage brain causes the mayhem of puberty. It helps parents to understand their teenage children better. The kids can't help the irritating things they do. It's their brain development stage that causes it. Not only bad things, but also the teenage brain is more capable of being creative and developming personal talents. The book was more scientific and less practical than I expected, but the science is explained in easy language and with practical examples. This makes it, and the very interesting subject matter, accessible to all. Eveline Crone is very young herself, but already a world class scientist and member of the Dutch equivalent of the Royal Society.
Lovely children's book about a grandmother Ying-ying telling her three granddaughters of a harrowing adventure she had one year long ago when she was herself a little girl. An adventure that taught her an important lesson in life. On the night of the Moon Festival, the Moon Lady, who grants secret wishes of those who ask, taught the child Ying-ying the lesson that the best wishes are the one's you can make come true yourself.The story in this book is adapted from a story in Amy Tan's best-seller The Joy Luck Club. Lovely illustrations by Gretchen Schields.
I am not into Science Fiction, but this book gripped me and pulled me into a world with concepts and possibilities unknown to me. Real life, an almost real gameworld and unexpected SF developments. It could have been pulled together a little tighter, but I still enjoyed it. I may even read the sequels...
Love story of an American volunteer in the Italian army and a young British nurse againt the backdrop of the First World War in Italy. Hemingway's writing really takes you there and makes you feel the desperation on senselessness of war...
I enjoyed this Chinese police detective novel. The main character Chief Inspector Chen Cao is a likeable intelligent good honest cop who is at the same time also a poet in his own right and a Chinese literature scholar. I like the way Chen refers to and relates to Chinese poets and their lines of poetry in the course of his detective work. The novel is set in Shanghai in 1990, exactly the period I lived in the Peoples' Republic of China myself, so I recognize the descriptions of everyday life and the political situation from personal experience. The way ordinary people had to balance the new possibilities and freedoms of the "opening-up" policy and the wariness and fear of possible political U-turns and repercussions is well depicted. For me the book contained a little too much explaining of the political situation, but perhaps this is necessary for a reader without my insider knowledge and experience. It was a good read.
Short novel (read in Dutch translation)describing the dehumanisation of the main character Gregor Samsa. One morning he wakes up and finds he has become a huge insect. His surroundings find it difficult to cope with the change. Clear style,pleasant read, you want to know what happens to Gregor even though you do not really identify with him.The book is not overly clear as to the deeper meaning. But I would say it describes how someone can become alienated from their surroundings and family when he loses his capacity to make a meaningful contribution to life. (Don't read further: spoileralert)From one day to the next Gregor loses his capacity to lead a meaningful human life. And with each day as an insect he becomes less and less human. His colleagues drop him immediately, his family try to care for him but soon they too are alienated. Gregor realises that even when he was human he was not much of a man. He was insignificant in his work as a travelling salesman, but still had some respect from his family as he was the main provider. After his metamorphosis he loses his worth for the family as a provider and becomes a burden to them. They gradually cease to see him as their son and brother, eventually neglecting him and driving him to his death. At the end he has lost all self-respect,he has lost himself and become something 'other'.
I love English literature of this period. I very much enjoyed this book. The Mill on the Floss tells of the trials and tribulations of a young Miller's daughter Maggie Tulliver. Starting life in comfortable circumstances in a rural community just outside a small town, the emotional but strong-willed Maggie faces trials and tribulations after the downfall of her father. Always yearning after love and attention from those she loves, a strong sense of honour, propriety and self-sacrifice causes her much inner struggle. I liked the main character Maggie very much, sympathizing with her plight and wishing her well. Although all her points of pain and trouble are resolved at the end of the book, I hated the ending.A.S. Byatt's introduction was excellent, giving much food for thought and adding intellectual depth to my understanding of the book. I'll have to read it again now that I have finished the book.

I finished the book in less than a week and really enjoyed reading it! Some parts made me very emotional, some parts made me question the true nature of humans. Its a very refreshing way of looking at things in my opinoin and it keeps us aware of the ways our society could be worse. Although many people find distopian books depressing, I see it in a different way. It makes me see that this life could always be worse and makes me thankfull for how we live now. Amazing book, really well written and just good to read <3
Very important and impressive book - but horrific..
Compelling read, food for thought
3.5 star. Nice unique and confusing balance between dream and reality, but in some stories Murakami made that a little too obvious.
Recommended!

Consistency is necessary for footnotes and bibliography, not for interpretation and understanding. O'Hara demonstrates that fundamental notion eloquently and succinctly.

Witch each breath, I feel winter passing.I close my eyes, and I breathe her in, and I think about this home that belongs to neither of us, and I lisen to the fire crackling, and I feel the warmth of the room and of her body, and we are okay.We are okay."
Rather mediocre and formulaic Poirot mystery, but nevertheless a perfectly enjoyable read. This novel was published in 1969, and it shows. Quite funny how Christie parodied herself with the character of Mrs. Oliver, and how that seems to allude to her not taking it too seriously anymore. It's somewhat peculiar to read a Poirot whodunnit not set in the 1930s, and instead in the late sixties. References to more modern topics caught me off guard, and Poirot himself was clearly still stuck in the 'Golden Age of Mystery' he is so strongly associated with.I read this in preparation for the new film 'A Haunting in Venice', but because its plot appears to not resemble the original story in the slightest, I might as well not have done so.
Very interesting read! The history of dress codes isn't just about clothing, but parallels the histories of racism, sexuality, sexism and much more. It was very interesting to discover the interconnectedness of seemingly unrelated trends and developments, such as how the cut of Edward VIII's trousers indirectly caused race riots in the US, or how postcolonial thought gave rise to the 'Sapeur'. It's a shame, however, that some long debunked myths were reiterated, such as the public outcry and riots caused by the appearance of the first top hat or the framing of the corset as a torture device, which caused me to doubt the other facts in the book. I also do not subscribe to the notion of the necktie as a phallic symbol, since ties were originally worn with waistcoats and only later developed into their modern shape. An insert with images was frequently mentioned, but unfortunately not included in my copy.All in all quite interesting!
At times not quite sure what I was reading, but it did give a whole new meaning to the concept of pen pals.
Very curious to read the story, but there were so many details I couldn't get through it.
I didn't realise this was part of a series till I was halfway through the story. Did not completely understand all references because of that. I liked the way the author chose to show how Mia sees, thinks and tries to solve the case(s). Too many characters and names were thrown at me and despite I loved the build-up I have the feeling that the author rushed the end a bit. Very strange and sudden end of the story.
Best history I have yet read
Very influential book that should be a must read in any young man's book list! 10/10
Amazingggg it’s a shame it only goes till chapter 12! Hope she will finish it.
Simply beautiful and impressing
A beautiful book to read but also very hard to get through. Still I enjoyed reading it.
I really loved it. As a fan of Star Wars Rebels I think it's great to know more about Kanan and Hera's background.
Lovely book!
Lots of insights. Although it may be a tough topic, the book is easy to read.
Actually I was a little afraid for this book, but there was no need to. A good addition to some other books I read. Interesting insights, quickly written, with a laugh and a tear :-)
I found it difficult to read. Maybe this one is just not for me...
Not a very accessible book nor one that I enjoyed reading. I committed myself to reading this book and I did. There are certainly many wise things in it, although I think there are books with the same message that are more easy to read. Because you spend a year, in my case even more than a year, with it on a daily basis, it certainly changes your look on a number of things. Would I recommend it? No, I don't think so...
Easy to read, very inspiring. Reading made me happy already :-)
Not always easy to read, but a lot of interesting insights.
I think the title of this book says it all. A course in Miracles is not easy to read, this book does! It helped me to stay motivated to read and understand A course in Miracles.
Such a lovely and humorous graphic novel about introversy!
My first Graphic Novel, so sweet and lovely!
at least he didn't have to go to his dreadful job anymore !
it might me a me problem but i did not shed a single tear, sorry . the ending made my eyes water a bit - the ending was beautifulit was disturbing, yes, but most of the bad stuff was so predictable that it wasn't as shocking as it actually is moral of the story: please talk to your friends and stop pretending things are okay when they are clearly not
I'm just wondering how everybody was pronouncing the characters names in their head

Tony got it finally, but my brain still hurts and I'm afraid i don't get it, and maybe I'll never will
Tolstoy is just amazing - his language, his depiction of human life, I feel swept away and transformed when reading his work. The Kreutzer Sonata is a rather short novella but so so good. Maybe Tolstoy's visions about matrimony seem outdated. However, at the time, this painful depiction of a couple suffering through their marriage must have been revolutionary. Two thumps up: for me, this is a definitive must-read!
Such a beautiful use of language! The most evocative and moving depiction of the impact of music that I have read yet!
wildly inventive and wonderful. Everything one could ask for from the classic writer of 19th century 'science-fiction'
perfectly nuanced, critical and analytical. Focuses on the complex relationship between nationalism and the process of democratisation in post-communist Europe. Very insightful!
nice.. good read, engaging characters, just for a thriller not too exciting
actually, I didn't finish this one completely. I went on holiday and purposfully "forgot" it at home. don't get why people love his books. It's stupid!
Finished this yesterday. Actually, it turned out to be quite a fast read after getting through the first chapters. The reasons it only gets two stars from me is this: I simply was not feeling with any of the characters, not really caring for their faith and remained fairly disinterested throughout. For sure, the topic is engrossing and it was interesting to hear about the Asian side of WWII, which I have never read a novel about before. But again, I need to be interested in the characters in order to enjoy a novel - and I was not.
simultaneously read with Laxness' wonderful and extraordinary "Independent People" (which I simply cannot praise too much) this one was a fast and enjoyable adventure tale. Long Jon Silver was a great villain and a compelling figure that I could even feel for and relate to. Other than that, treasure island is, seen through today's eyes, a fairly straightforward tale. It is indeed the very work that gave us the stereotypes of ruthless pirates with parotts hunting treasures. You can well see Stevenson's genius at imagining those figures and fleshing them out so well that they invaded our cultural rememberance and image of pirates up until today!
Very profound. Much better than Fawn's book on the Czech Republich, albeit both were published as part of one series. As there is not much literature on Slovakia, this one's a must.
I just can't get used to the overly spiritual side of Hermann Hesse. I love his only true realist novel, Unterm Rad, very much though
very educational, helped me actually understand the circumstances and incentives important economic thinkers from Smith to Keyenes and beyond were driven by. Highly recommended - wether you have any interest in economic thinking or just in philosophy or history.
I love Ishiguro's clear cut yet never simplifying way of writing. This is one of the best books I have ever read and one of the few where I actually cried my eyes out at the end
Since I recently wrote paper about scientology, a totalitarian and possibly very dangerous sect, this was a very interesting read for me. In particular, the last parts in which Mortan talks about the unhealthy relationship between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes has been quite a read. Of course, there is a lot of speculation but Morton effectively and believably gets the point accross that Scientology changed Cruise's personality - not for the good, that is. There was also a lot of blah in the good, which I just skipped. Hence, three stars for an enjoyable read and a courageous yet sometimes unfocused effort.
One of the best books I have read... ever!I can understand how some people would have to hate this book. It is dense-full of philosophy, which could be a turn-off but which I thoroughly enjoyed!Plus, Kundera writes in the most wunderful prose and I have never read about such a heart-rendering death of a dog. I cried at the end, which must have meant that it was really, really good and worth every second!
Well, what can I say? It was just a trash-read after all. I enjoy trashy books once in a while so nothing wrong with that. The book is a conspiration thriller mixed with some historical elements. It all seemed quite promising and in fact, I enjoyed the first 300 or so pages out of 500 a lot. However, after that I started to realize that the mystery/chase is not leading anywhere particularily exciting. In fact, the twist and turns were all more or less lame with good people always remaining good and bad people vice versa: hence, not much of a surprise! The end was, accordingly, quite lame and didn't offer any sort of surprise. Hence, since I still enjoyed the book to some extent, 2 stars... I wouldn't recommend it to anybody though and am kind of mad at my mom for handing this over to me!
It has been a long time since I have read a book that has meant so much to me. This reading experience literally transported me to the harsh landscape of Iceland and I was right there with the characters. Bjartur, the lonesome farmer, self-proclaimed independent protagonist is a man full of mistery. It is easy to hate him but yet I think one needs to take into consideration the more than harsh circumstances. Ultimately, his aim to be independent and to raise an independent family is a noble one although one doomed to failure. The most compelling figure of the novel was, for me, Asta Solillja, the daughter and yet not the daughter of Bjartur. The relationship between those two is one that I was following with the greatest compassion, anger and regret throughout the novel.As I said, it has been a long time since a novel has touched my heart in the way "Independent People" has done. Laxness is for sure one of the great writers of the 20th century and one worthy of the nobel-prize for literature. I am looking forward to reading more from this extraordinary man and to get transported once more to this strange and astonishing place called Iceland.
wonderful and heartwrenching depiction of a life-long friendship between two opressed women in rural china of the 19th century. Man beachte auch mein review auf www.a-vela.de!
One of the better books which I have read from the fantastic discworld series. This is my first book from the guards mini-series and it might just become my favourite strand! Discworld is awesome - everybody should check this series out. It is the glorious exception where quantity of books does not imply a loss of quality. Almost all discworld novels are treasures and Terry Pratchett continues to surprise me, even though I have read so many of his novels!
well, it still is the same old Jane Austen. Sorry, all JA lovers, but to me Austen's style of writing, while certainly witty, is not all that interesting. Maybe I'm missing something but I tried Jane Austen twice this summer and I won't read another book of her for a long time.
surprisingly fresh! I enjoyed it very much and found it through the dutch edition of the 1001 books. Very odd that it isn't included in the "international" edition!
a wonderful classic of one of the great french realists. This was my first Balzac novel but for sure not my last. I enjoy classic novels with classic themes - love - in general and this one was heartwrenching and written by an excellent novelist. I liked his attention to character, the plot as well as the description of all the details. I was really able to delve into this world and feel with poor Eugenie. Luckily, my parents have the whole Comedie Humaine at home so I'll surely be able to find some more pearls in there!
This started very strong: poetic language, great plot about a village under suppression by an evil landlord (aga) and likeably characters. However, during the course of the novel I lost interest, as the hero (Mehmed) turns into a second-rate Robin Hood and all of the interesting bits about village life fade into the backround. Still, I liked reading the book and I learned quite some things about Turkish village life. So, three stars from me: after all, Mehmed my Hawk is considered a national treasure in Turkey!
I abandoned the last world. Probably it's a great book but I now too little about Ovid and the metamorphoses to enjoy this one. A typical book to get back to at a later point in my life... once I'm older and wiser :-). The subtle knife started great, though. Pulled me in directly and sounds even more promising than the fabulous fist book of the series.Finished it at the beginning of August. It captured me totally, very moving, very deep and truly a YA novel for thinking, critical adults. I am very curious how this plan to kill god will turn out in the last book.
It's a pity so few people know this book! A father searching for his dead daughter, conspiracies, the overall theme on how to cope with life: great, albeit a bit fussy at the end!
not nearly as good as I expected it to be. To be honest, I was bored. Every time I thought that I might stumble on an interesting passage it turned out to be anti-climax. And the "hero" of the story, I even forgot his name by now, was a truly uninteresting one.
This rarely happens to me: I just could not finish this book. I found it unbearable and about half-way through I really did not care about how these stories would continue. In my opinion, it is incredibly poorly written and frankly, I found these robot stories dull and boring content-wise as well. I read that this is supposed to be one of the classics of sci-fi. I don't have a lot of experience with that genre but if this book is supposed to be one of the best, I doubt the genre is for me.I'll now go back to Kazantakis' 'the last temptation'. This, for once, is a very well written and inspiring story... more my cup of tea, I must say!
almost too clever to be reserved purely for children!
just couldn't get used to the characters. I especially believed the women to be flat
Enjoyed it too, though maybe not quite as well as the first one. The early Kristin had grown to me and I could really relate to her. maybe it's my age though.
super short but an indicator of the great quality of Mister Marquez
not particularily good, although not brutally bad either. Just a dull little story about a man and his family caught between rural life in the German community of Romania (Banat) and the hectic life of Germany. Could have been good, but stayed mediocre throughout.
shallow. didn't get much out of this one. So Meciar was a bad guy? Ok, I guess I have to read more books on this topic to find out why.
I still think it's a sick Idea. not too interested in pedophiles and their amourous adventures
This was a difficult book for me to tackle - I finally finished it yesterday and I am glad I stuck with it. In essence, this is a retelling of the life of Jesus Christ and of the ultimate necessity of his death. For me, for the most part of the book, Kazantzakis wrote a very spiritual novel, faithful to the gospels. As I am not really religious, some parts were really hard to get through, hence, I had to stop several times in order to read something in between. In the end, though, Kazantzakis does offer a twist to the story, although I still find it incredibly that the Catholic Church banned this book! Jesus, while hanging on the cross, imagines a life for him in peace and matrimony, as a human being on Maria Magdalena's sight. I would have loved to read more about this alternative vision but unfortunately it only onfolds on the last 30 pages or so. Still, this book gave me a lot to think about and a new insight into christianity. Judas, for instance, is here not imagined as the betrayer but instead as the most sceptical but at the same time most faithful of the Apostels. In the end, I would reccomend this book to anyone having an interest in the story of the Gospels and in christianity as such. The book is written beautifully, at times for me unbearable but at other times very moving. I would have wished for a more 'revolutionary' read but as it stands the book still certainly deserves a place among the classics!
This is my third Austen book since summer 2007. Actually, after not getting too excited about pride and prejudice, I thought I wouldn't read any Jane Austen any time soon. Somehow, though, I came across both Emma and now Sense and Sensibility as audiobooks. Listening instead of reading Jane Austen was, I think, a more enjoyable experience for me. The book was nice and typical for this writer. I can see why JA is appraised and adored by so many but I still think her books are kind of... boring. As for the 1001 books list, I still don't get why ALL of JA's novels have to be included on the list. Two or three, in my humble regard, would have been entirely sufficient!
I just listened to the first short episode on audiobook. I was sad when it ended: Anne is a very spirited little heroine and I can't wait to listen to the rest of her story. I am amazed that this great classic of children's fiction is so little known in Germany.
At first, I was pretty hesitant to even pick up this book at all. I thoroughly enjoyed "the curious incident of the dog in the night time" and thus I feared I would be disappointed. Also, the story did not sound too engaging: 61-year old man loses his mind and all the rest of the family members have some kind of problem as well... plainly, it sounded boring!However, I did pick up the book mainly because I was - and still am - in love with the cover art. My version, picked up in the US, is lightgreen and there is a cartonized man standing in a puddle of blood with his leg chopped of. Quite gory, actually, in a cutesy kind of way. This cover really grabbed my attention and promised me a story that would be far more engaging than what I read at the back cover.The raving review of the new york times ("this is a fine example why novels exist") in the end turned out to be true. Yes, the story is pretty normal, nothing other-worldly happening, just a man and his family coping with insaneness and an upcoming wedding. stil, I enjoyed it greatly, did not feel bored once and was really there with the characters, which is always important to me when I read a novel. I liked each of the family members and really could identify with them throughout the book. the end fit the charming style as well, although it wasn't anything too wild or fancy (which I also did not expect).In the end, I am really surprised and kind of shocked that it didn't even make the long list of the man-booker last year. Who won again? no clue! That this one wasn't honored in any sort of way is really a spot of bother to me!So, to anyone looking for a surprisingly good new, second novel by a very promising new author, pick this one up! I sure will be watching out for Haddon's next novel and I am already curious of what he comes up with next!
Not only is the story described in this book super interesting, but it is also really well-written with lots of witty jokes! One of the best non-fiction books I have read (hence it only took me a bit more than a week to finish it) and, hopefully, one that gets hooked on reading again. Mindf*ck describes the inner workings of Cambridge Analytica as the whistleblower himself wrote this book. I loved that the book tells an engaging story but also introduces different (partly philosophical) topics like behaviour as a commodity and looking at internet services as utilities. A must-read for any person working in data and definitely recommended for anyone interested in politics and how Cambridge Analytica influenced the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.
This 1942 Steinbeck novel was written as a propaganda piece in support of the Allied effort against Nazi Germany. The Oxford Dictionary defines propaganda as ideas or statements that may be false or exaggerated and that are used in order to gain support for a political leader, party, etc. This book is the happy exception to the negativity of propaganda. The book describes a fictive story of a small village near a coal mine under occupation (though it is implied it is nowhere mentioned it is Nazis occupying the village). The overall story describes how the village people go from confusion to anger to revolt and all the emotions connected with this. In the occupied countries of the time, the book was a huge hit, with many people hailing how accurately Steinbeck described their emotions and the situation as a whole. In America, the book was initially dismissed as it paints the occupiers as people following orders with their own desires, often longing to go home. Implying the novel was too soft on the Nazis. Only in the years after the war did this negative sentiment turn around. The story itself is not super special, but Steinbeck's excellent writing style and the historical context surrounding the book still make it a very worthwhile read!
I was familiar with the basics of SCRUM and some of the terminology but to read about the origins and the ideas behind it is very impressive. I'm definitely going to use the theory in my daily life!
Really interesting book that is outside of what I've ever read before. The book is written as a dialogue between the youth and the philosopher as was before done by Plato to convey the ideas of Socrates. While both discussing philosophy and psychology this book shares the theories of Adler, an Austrian philosopher and contemporary of the more famous Jung and Freud. The book is dubbed as a self help book but instead of focussing on reinventing yourself it speaks of being happy with what you have which is discussed in depth and feels like a fresh thought between all the modern self help books.
3.5 starsI listened through this book on Audible relatively quickly. The book is definitely an enjoyable listen, and the story is very gripping. The book details Stéphane Breitwieser's story and obsession with stealing art. Between 1995 and 2001, Stéphane and his then-girlfriend stole 250+ works of art from antique revolvers, ivory art, and silver candleholders to complete oil paintings. The story is fascinating and the level of detail of research on the crimes the author did is remarkable. That said, the story somehow stays on the level of a true-crime podcast. The level of detail of the thefts is nice, but the story as a whole and the analysis of both Stéphane and his girlfriend Anne-Catherine somehow lack depth to me. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book if you like non-fiction and are in for something that reads like an adventurous novel!
The story was ones again enjoyable and funny but it felt less engaging than the previous book.
Read like a second part to his breakthrough book Kitchen Confidential. The first book feels like the rougher brother where this book seems more civilised. Because of its unapologetic nature Kitchen Confidential was one of my favourite books of the year. While Medium Raw has some really good chapters, some others I failed to connect with.
One of the best books I read in recent years. The book keeps throwing you off and keeps you curious about what will happen next. As the translator describes it: "readers may find their allegiances shifting in the course of the story, becoming confused and ambivalent." If I could give the book six stars I would. Written by a Slovenian writer in the 1930s the book describes the story of the Ismaeli, a branch of Islam around the year 1100. The book describes the devotion of normal people to their leaders and how leaders can use and abuse their power. Keeping in mind the novel was originally dedicated to Mussolini the fascist leader of Italy it is as much a political story as it is an adventure story.
An easy and quick read about how to protect yourself against misleading statistics and visualizations! Interesting if you regularly follow the use or make data visualizations yourself.
Really well-written book! The style is engaging and stays entertaining by combining real-life negotiation examples and negotiation theory. I do think the book does more than just give the reader the knowledge to gain an edge in a negotiation. The techniques described in the book and the psychology behind them are applicable in different situations from basic discussion to actual contract negotiations.
5 stars - A must-read book, in my opinion. While the book is not perfect, the story it tells is invaluable. For a while, I have been interested in food and what can be considered healthy with all the different opinions on this out there. I read "In Defence of Food" by Michael Pollen a while ago, and while it puts forward an interesting hypothesis, it didn't grasp or convince me. Ultra-Processed People is very well-researched, focussing on academic literature, and, as such, more convincing to me. The book focuses on what humanity eats, which is, at the moment, mostly Ultra Processed Food. "Most UPF is not food... it’s an industrially produced edible substance." Processed foods (like milk, yoghurt, etc.) are out of this category, but the book focuses on how Ultra Processing is related to a lot of the obesity wave humanity is going through and many diseases of our time. The book describes the characteristics of UPF in detail without sounding evangelical or judgemental. Different facts and observations stuck with me which still changed my perception of UPF and actually already changed my behaviour and attitude.
On my search on YouTube for free audio books came across this one. Very interesting book especially if you put it in its timeframe being written in the early 20th century. Sadly not really my taste though.
Really nice to read this book again. I remembered the generic outlines of the story but to refresh it is really impressive.It is necessary to understand the zeitgeist in which the book was published to fully understand it and its underlying purpose. I can certainly recommend to read Orwell's proposed preface as published by Penguin Books to gain this understanding.
3.5 StarsA book from the early 2000s about Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system. It gives a sense of how Linus is as a person while cracking some fun jokes about software development and Finland along the way. It is a light read and definitely a fun book with some takeaways. Was just missing some depth and reasons/arguments behind his statements. The book at times felt quite shallow and left me guessing about the reasons behind his (design) choices.
An extremely vivid insight into the lives in North Korea. The book reads as a novel even though its journalistic content. Would definitely recommend this to friends!
While I did enjoy the read I cannot say it is a book for me. The author Matt Haig describes his personal experience with depression and reflects on it. I expected a more in-depth look into depression contrary to the more simple reflections in this book (possibly because of reading The Collected Schizophrenias prior to this). The book is written in a very simple style with short paragraphs and chapters which pushed me more away from the book as opposed to making the book easier to pick up. I suppose the book is for people who are starting to understand depression and want a first glance into the mind of a depressed person.
Really enjoyed reading this Dutch literary classic again. Read the book in high-school but mostly forgot the storyline. To me, the book was a real page-turner as it reads like a boys adventure novel but while progressing you start noticing deeper motives and multiple layers. The book takes place in and around World War II in the Netherlands and describes the story of a simple cigar shop owner that never did much with his life. Married to his seven-year older full niece and never being able to grow a beard the guy had always been an outsider. The book describes accidental his descent into the Dutch resistance during the war and the following consequences.
Our democracy is being wrecked by being limited to elections, even though elections weren’t invented as a democratic instrument. That, in one sentence, is the argument I develop in this essay.The book outlines a very compelling argument as to why elections are not the way forward for democracies and how they are currently even hurting our democracy. Many of the complaints we all have about democracy can be seen as symptoms of the core democratic system; elections.The alternative being discussed in the book is choosing candidates by chance. This is done through a random draw from the population for a multitude of different chambers that comprise the full government and can take many different forms. It argues in favour of drawing candidates by discussing the history of democracies, describing the systems in Athens, Venice, France and the US. I had read about the successes of citizen councils before, but to have a complete overview of the thoughts behind similar systems left a big impression! The book is an essay as it does set out to convince you of the pros of a random draw and the drawbacks of elections. I read the book in Dutch as David Van Reybrouck is a Flemish speaker, which also added to the fun for me as it had been a long time since I read a book in Dutch.
An extraordinary book in which the author herself has been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder in her 20s while studying at Yale and later with schizophrenia. The book describes her experiences being diagnosed with mental illness and the effects, including several hospitalisations. The book put the disease in perspective for me and gave me a new outlook on mental disease, one that is rarely described, from the perspective of the people living with it day in day out. While the book is fairly technical and as such not a light read I'd definitely recommend it if you're interested in the topic.
An impressive book about growing up during apartheid in South Africa. Trevor Noah really impressed me with his story and him reflecting on his own actions. I can recommend the book as an audiobook as Trevor Noah reads it himself.Only note that I'd have is that the book is a bit all over the place with the chapters.
Finished the book in a day on the Bratislava airport. While not eye-opening it is a really good read and lets you reconsider things that are currently happening in the world. The book gives 'tips' for our current time based on the 20th century: Nazi Germany, Communist Czechoslovakia, Communist Russia and the techniques these regimes used.
I just read through this book at a pace I don't do often. An immensely impressive memoir about the impact education can have on a person and an unique insight into parts of America that are not usually written about.
An amazing and inspiring tale of how Nike was founded. It takes you through all the highest and lowest points but above all it's hugely inspiring to seek a calling, even if one doesn't know what it means, to at least search for it. "And those who urge entrepreneurs to never give up? Charlatans. Sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn't mean stopping. Don't ever stop."
While the book is an easy listen it does not offer many new insights for people already familiar with Trump's history before he became president. Mary L. Trump gives insights into the family dynamics and how Trump could become the person he currently is due to his father, Fred Trump. The focus of the book is more on the family as a whole instead of Donald Trump and his upbringing.
This book really opened my eyes into the world of good goal setting! Lots of good resources in the book that you can immediately put to practical use.I gave the book only 4 starts as in my opinion, at the end of the book the examples start to be too many with little added value. It is portrayed like every business became a huge success just because of OKRs which lacks some depth sometimes.
A really entertaining book. Read really quickly through it and was sucked into it by all the misteries only revealed to the reader at the end. The book offers a great story around religion, technology and the quick progression of A.I.That being said it sadly lacked the depth of earlier books of Dan Brown but it might also be that I'm a more advanced reader at the moment compared to previous years. It's not a book with deep intricate characters but a book that's deeply entertaining and a very quick read for it being 500 pages.
I'm definitely left speechless after finishing the Beekeeper of Aleppo. The book describes the life of Nuri, a beekeeper in Aleppo and his wife Afra who is an artist. This was of course before the war in Syria. It describes their journey to reach Europe as refugees and their losses endured along the way. While it is a work of fiction it feels realistic, causing endless respect and sympathy with those around us that really had to endure this journey, each with their own story. With the book being a work of fiction it allows for beautiful metaphors and a whole different layer to the story. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. A great start for 2021.
A great book to understand how Putin got to power in the 90s and 2000s and his (possible) motivations behind recent actions like the annexation of Crimea. It gave me great insights on how Russia is currently functioning and how Putin is being kept in power. The thing that keeps me from giving this book 5-stars it that it seems a bit of a one-sided view. It is difficult to get an honest understanding when this book is being written from the American side with the assistance of people like Boris Nemtsov. That being said I thoroughly enjoyed the book and definitely recommend it if you are eager to learn more about Russia after the Soviet Union.
I am still reading many articles on the war in Ukraine on a daily basis. With articles about weapons delivery, geopolitical tactics and military tactics, it is often easy to forget the many tragedies on a smaller scale. Each soldier, their friend and family have their own story to tell; each Ukrainian has their own story to tell. I believe it's important to read these stories and not forget what is on the line for every person in Ukraine. Life. Fight. Survive. as a whole is gripping and well-written. It talks about Shaun's time before arriving in Ukraine, his marrying and living in Mariupol before the full-scale invasion and shares his time spent with the Ukrainian marines, ultimately leading to him getting captured and becoming a POW. You wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy what Shaun Pinner went through as a POW. It is horrifying to hear under what conditions POWs were held. Overall, I especially appreciate how Shaun talked about his personal thoughts at different times throughout the story. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the war in Ukraine.
A really impressive book. The combination of the authors literal and neuroscientific knowledge makes it an amazing read. The book struggles with questions about death, you get a peak in to the life of a terminally ill person while being able to step out of it at any moment in time. Would definitely recommend all my friends to read this!
One of the best books I read this year. Instead of seeing ISIS as a sudden appearance, this book explains its origins and what made this possible. The book gives a deep understanding of many of the geopolitical events throughout the middle east. Starting in 1980s Jordania and obviously ending with the founding of the Khalifate and ISIS. By telling a lot of these stories through quotes and direct accounts of people who were there the book keeps the attention contrary to many other books describing history.
4.5 stars I had this book with me for the last half a year as I did not progress with it for some months. When I picked it up seriously again, I did move through it relatively quickly. The book follows a roughly chronological path and, in ~250 pages, goes through the entire length of the Cold War. It is impressive how the whole Cold War can be condensed into 250 pages. The book has many interesting points for someone who never lived during the Cold War. How neutrality of third nations was used to extort both superpowers in the 50s and 60s. The extent of election meddling done in third countries by both sides of the Cold War. How the Brezhnev doctrine ended in Poland with Lech Walesa and, in general, the importance of outside players (like Pope John Paul II) during the Cold War. The book is often written from the point of view of the main actors in the Cold War, with many quotes from them to explain their actions and thoughts. While I am no expert and fully trust the author, this sometimes raises questions as one wonders if the quotes are cherry-picked to form a particular narrative. Many lessons can still be learned from the Cold War in our current times, so I can recommend this book to those interested in history. It is like reading a densely packed summary of the Cold War. One of the lessons learned that I hope will stay true in current times: "J. Robert Oppenheimer hinted at a better explanation when he predicted in 1946 that "if there is another major war, atomic weapons will be used." The man who ran the program that built the bomb had the logic right, but the Cold War inverted it: what happened instead was that because nuclear weapons could be used in any new great power war, no such war took place. By the mid-1950s, these lethal devices, together with the means of delivering them almost instantly anywhere, had placed all states at risk.
Really cool book on the impact AI (and as such superintelligence) could have on humanity. It does not draw conclusions but gives the reader all the different directions it could go. Even though I really liked the book it does sometimes dive into the matters a bit deep which makes it difficult to get through. The book goes from talking about the origin of computers to the meaning of conscience to Dyson spheres.
A really amazing book. Clearly explains how many of our current organisational believes, management techniques and organisational structures are out-dated and tailored to the needs of the 19th and 20th century. It also shows a clear path into how to adapt these old structures to fit the current complex world and create an agile organisation that can quickly react to outside influences. The book shows some great examples from other companies but the red line through the book is the organisational change that The Task Force went through in the early 2000s in its fight against Al Qaeda in Iraq. In my opinion, the book became more interesting due to this red line throughout the whole book. Got some ideas from this book although I still need to work these out more.
Written in an almost poetic way. Quite an interesting read but not too special in my opinion.
A thrilling and exciting story about a female spy during the second world war and the start of the cold war. The book reads like a piece of fiction while, in fact, it is a non-fiction book. Excellently written by Ben Macintyre. Picked up the book because I recently moved to Berlin. The book starts in Berlin around the 1930s with the coming up of Hitler. It describes the life of Ursula Kuczynski, a German Jewish woman who becomes a Soviet spy. Macintyre describes the life of Ursula in China in the 1940s and in Switzerland and Great Britain during the second world war. The book is detailed but doesn't overdo the details with the risk of becoming boring. What stuck with me most while reading the book is how communism as an ideology was seen as a true alternative to capitalism. This is contrary to the current day and age in which the failures of the USSR and current-day China are inseparably connected to the ideas of communism. This definitely makes me want to read more about communism as an ideology instead of solely in the context of a failed state. Would definitely recommend this book!
This book is full of great humour. I was doubting a bit between a 4 and a 5-star rating as to me the story wasn't the best. That being said the jokes and the statistical jokes in the book make it a great read (or listen in my case as it was the first audiobook I ever listened to) for every geeky engineer.
A very impressive novel detailing the story of Nickel School for Boys. Nickel is a fictional juvenile prison in 1960s Florida during the Jim Crow era. The book describes the fictional story of Elwood, who accidentally ends up in this prison because he hitchhiked in the wrong car. However, most of the story is based on true events at Florida's Dozier School. A true horror school where some 81 boys died (https://www.npr.org/2012/10/15/162941...). A really impressive historical novel that sheds light on some of the darkest moments in recent US history.
5 starsAmazing autobiography; this book is definitely one of the better audiobooks I've listened to in a while. I listened through the book in less than a week! The book not only tells an unbelievable story but also an inspirational tale of the power of the human mind and perseverance. The autobiography tells the story of Nando Parrado, who, together with his rugby team in 1972, experiences a plane crash in the middle of the Andes. They survive in the extreme conditions of the Andes for 72 days through their ingenuity and sheer willpower. Ultimately, the group is saved after Nando and Roberto make a ten-day track to civilization, climbing a +4.5km high mountain in the process. More than just the factual story this book allows for a look at the thoughts of Nando. How did he experience this, and how did he deal with the ordeal afterwards? How their interpretation of Christianity helped them in their survival. How, in his own words, choosing to live to honour the victims saved him from PTSD or survivor guilt.
Do you own this one? I really liked the movie and the realistic aspects!
Poetic musings... but I had a hard time really getting into the story.
A MUST read for any person who wants to find the path to harmonious maturity and personal growth. No, I take that back. A must read for any person on planet Earth. Also very interesting for individuals undergowing psychotherapy, as it gives a clear view on the process of client-centered therapy, and the direction the client should move in.The central question in this book is: what does it mean to become a person? The most important aspects of this are awareness of experiences (feelings), full acceptance of these experiences, and immediate communication of these experiences. This comes down to fully accepting yourself as a living organism (meaning a continious flow/process) with all its contradictions and complexities. This takes time and often comes with fear, struggle and questioning all mental constructs you have created for yourself. The beautiful thing is: Rogers argues it is irreversible. I dare anyone to pick up this book and give it a try.
** spoiler alert ** Admittedly, I have some problems with this alleged classic. I admire the setting and premise of the book, but as far as the characters go, it doesnt make sense to me.First there is Chief, our eyes and ears. The whole story is told through his experience. But why? We dont know who he is, what exactly brought him here or why he is still there. Also, for all the years he has been there he has not talked for childhood reasons. Okay. But then he suddenly starts talking and everyone is complerely okay with that? How? At the end of the book he returns to his people. He says he wants to look over the falls and gorge again and that its been a long while, then why hasnt he gone sooner?Next McMurphy. We hardly know anything about him. Just rumours about his years prior to coming to the ward. What drives him and why? Then there is the Big Nurse. She seems to be a pretty woman whose sole purpose seems to be to keep the patients quiet and in the ward. But why???? Who is she? What drives her? Everything she does seems to be to maintain her dominance in the ward. For this she uses cunning games and social nudges during the therapeutic group sessions; quite strange for the head nurse. In the end she even turns McMurphy in a Vegetable for his behavior. What is wrong with her?It seems this book is incredibly popular, but at this point I dont immediately see why. Maybe I’ll see someday.
A one sitting kind of book. I used to tell everyone I wish I were able to write like Oscar Wilde, but as of now I wish to have the writing skills of Ian McEwan.I just love how the characters are so dislikable, some more than others. My favorite character? Molly.
A very fun read. The ending was very predictable but it was nice and sweet. A book hardly ever makes my heart skip a beat yet this one did. Love it :)
I recommendeth thy readeth Romeo and Juliet
I loved the beginning and I was completely outraged about the plottwist. Quite disappointed about some of the choices Alina made in the book…
The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kidness infinite.
** spoiler alert ** I hated this book. It made no sense at all. Plot???? Never heard of it. The love story? Baaaaaad. The only reason why it got a star at all is because of the message in the last chapter and the main character being a black woman.
What an amazing sequel! Most sequels tend to bore me most of the time but this book was such a page-turner. Absolutely incredible. Can we talk about that ending though? I did not expect that. Wow. Will definitely be reading the next book soon.
I loved this book! Even though the story mostly revolves around death and sex, it was a good read and such an incredible story.
The fact that this story depicts toxic relationships and poor choices had led me to believe that this story isn’t about happiness and a fairytale-like love we expect from books at all. It is about merely existing and that is what makes the times exciting….
I loved how this book started and I really could not put it down, however I was quite disappointed by the ending. It lacked something in my opinion. I just wasn’t done reading it yet...
I just finished this and I already want to read it again. Chef’s kiss. Can’t wait to read the next books as well
I love love loved this boook!! However for anyone debating to read this book please consider the fact that it mentions self harm and ED. (This is your trigger warning). The ending was totally unexpected!!
I will probably love Murakami’s books for a while.
°•♡•°•♡•°•♡•°(thank you @sofie!!!)
Yayyy!!! Review!!!!!
Positive reading experience. Stifling atmosphere of protestant milieu.Silly father and disgusting proselyting "brother in the lord"
Read it twice.Impressive choice of names: vna de Karbargenbok, Schattenkeinder.Dutch classic: a teacher should not stoop, the child should climb.
Recommended by Beppie.Shocking scene of perverse pastor.
Belongs to the canon of Dutch literature.Humouristic approach to a depressed young man.
Monumental. Tough reading but impressive.
Terrible book. Regrettable waste of 20 hours. Old fashioned words.
Silly Laarmans with his house full of cheese.
Typical Grunberg. Sardonic humour and inescapable downfall of tragic hero.
Read it twiceHeavy stuff. Not impressed.
Read it twice.Moving story of Saidja en ?
I admire his style. The pornography partr of the young people is well written. The movo character is a bit elusive.
Jos Jacobs was enthousiastic about all the volumes of The Office.A pity I couldn't share this.Found it boring.
Unexpected suicide of sister.Very readable but rather psychological and relational.
A must read for every Dutchman. The word uitvreter was coined by Nescio, I gather.
Many, many names.Sebag is not concerned primarily with writing as coherent historical report.His interest is the person and character Stalin.Drawing his facts from archives, he wants to be verifiably correct but fails to write a story that reads more fluently than this compilation of places, people, girlfriends, exiles and escapes.Nevertheless I found it a worthwhile investment of time and energy to get a deeper insight in the man.
Familie Stastok.Too long ago to remember anything else.
I think I read this twice.He visited his dying brother in Oegstgeest's hospital in wartime.
Interesting story of a husband who was never at home and a wife that survived many tragedies and lived to a long age.
Didn't really like his repeated mentioning of the condition of his feet.Description of the Japanese camp guards and prisoners' camp life okay.
A must read for anyone who wants to know about junkies and the influence they have on their families.
I read quite a few of his books. I like his style but I also find him rather longwinded.
Honest portrait of a psychologically damaged father.
Account of illness child sympathetically written,Story around it rather weak.
Sentimental and egocentric. Honest, though.
Read a lot of Van Dis. Interesting.
Nothing new under the sun.
Smooth talking Laarmans gets to you in a way.
Impressive sex scene of housemaid screwed on the kitchen counter by hormone driven protagonist.
I liked the atmosphere.
I read it a long time ago when I was green behind my ears and shocked by the openly sexual language.
Way beyond me.Black holes, gravity, relativity, time warp, space-time, light years, astronomical distances.Facts but no feeling for tem from my part.
Childish and adolescent humour.Obsesses with urine, turds and dirty sex.Stupid repetitious interrogation technique.Amazing that the book found a publisher and that Mr Brusselmans does not feel embarrassed by his writings.
I only read the passages about Indonesia,Interesting and honest account of the atrocities committed by the Dutch.
Well written in a straightforward way. Sheds light on the great man from different angles. Very positive but with an entrance to a more critical view as well. Interesting for history fans and human interest seekers alike.
Cold and hysterical if I am not mistaken.Longwinded.
The writer seems to think he is more important than any of us.What is so special about this story?He does not seem to be ashamed of his alcoholism.
Not my favourite
Good book. Sympathy for the simple man. Compassionate and topical.
Thought it would be a difficult book.Far from it, caricatures of all four characters. The father,A.W.Gijselhart a misanthropist and a miser, The daughter, Prul, ugly, skinny and as nasty as her progenitor.Leendert, Broer, the homosexual art dealer in New York who left after the death of his catamyte and the slump in his affairs.The jew, 56-year-old father of Prul's bastard, Bruno Pechstein, brazenly taking possession of the Prulmuseum and although being fed and housed for free still having the audacity to criticize the Gijselhart's household and Doornenhof, their residence.
One of the first books I read.
Interesting biography of a kick boxer.Moving story of a Staffordshire Bull terrier Otis in asylum who had to be killed after defending his master but biting a hooligan.A piece of music of Otis Reading was chosen as an intro for Aaron Bachman's fights as a tribute to the dog he had loved very much.
I was impressed. It is horrible, sadistic and sad. Still the tone is light and it's an amusing read.
Read it for the second time.Amazing how you forget after 20 years.Concise and precise. I still remember vividly from first reading the book, the first climbing experience of the protagonist guiden by Lapland "sherpa's"
Many sad stories, several suicides.People tell her a lot.I have read Figes, Vasily Grosman ( Leven en lot, Alles stroomt) so the stories were quite familiar.
At times tough reading.Many figures. Depressing story.Why did nobody stop the mad destruction of nature, agriculture, animals and people?Horror cleanly and soberly described but how can people live in a country knowing this happened to their parents or grandparents.
Reminds me of Poe. Hysterical, nervous person.
Nice book. I recommended it to several people.Especially in Holland where Catholics held an important position is this book a must read.We knew it all but Brouwers has written with humour and exaggeration a novel that certainly contains more than a grain of truth about the awful and disgraceful situation at Dutch boarding schools run by friars.
Small book. A must for every Dutch pupil.One of forty or more books about the war that I have read.
Understood hteb ook after I had seen the film.
I was disappointed. After a promising beginning I was not too impressed anymore.
I also saw the film with jan de Cler
Reread. Nice style, very Mortierish but the story tends to evaporate.
Fat book. Some chapters interesting, some too full of facts- especially the one about political parties.
I read it for the second time.I only remembered the tea ceremony and the attacks on religion.I mistakenly thought that the idea that you can hurt people deeply without being aware of it, was illustrated in this book by the rich man meeting a girlfriend of his deep past, who had shared poverty with him and had given him a present though she couldn't really afford it.When they met again after many years , she saw the present on a cupboard and said she hated the ugly thing.He felt so hurt, having treasured this gift for such a long time, that he never wanted to see her anymore.The book was a big disappointment the second time.Amazing since I had pleasant memories of it.
Big disappointment.No story, no characters, no memories.
Not as good as Wagendorps friends of the papers want us to believe.
I think I liked it.
Saw the film. Read the book long ago. Not my favourite "t Harts.
Honest account of grandfather. A bit idolized. Rather solemn and humourless.
Amazing insight in dying process from the then 33-year-old writer.Kind of homage to the hard working and self-sacrificing Siberian mother.
Better than These are the names.
Interesting little story about a Greek lesson at a German Gymnasium in 1928.The lesson was inspected by Herr Direktor Himmler, the father of Heinrich.It was a very traumatic experience for 14-year-old Franz Kien (alter ego for Alfred Andersch)It is sensitive true to life report of a period of 50 minutes as experienced by a young German boy, whose father was a national socialist supporter and whose fellow students sported swastikas.
4.5 ⭐Such a thrilling read, from beginning to end. Can't wait to find out what happens next.The end was a bit too "easy" for me, but I am not complaining.
Did I ignore everything and everyone to read this? Yes.Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.
This was one of my favorite series when I was younger and as I was tidying my bookshelves in my childhood bedroom, I found it and decided it to read it again. I still understand why I loved it so much!
I feel like it was too slow for a mystery/thriller, at least for me, but I found the characters so interesting, I did not want to put it down.
4.5 ⭐Initially, I was unsure whether I would like it, as the first few chapters were long. But oh my goodness, I devoured this book! I could not put it down! I am hooked. Now, onto the next one...
3.5 ⭐After loving the first 3 books of the series, this felt a bit like a filler. Still a nice and cozy read.
The imagination in this book is immense! I wish I could be able to read it for the first time again and again...I especially loved the first part of the book as I got to build the House in my head with my own imagination from scratch. But as I also love a good mystery, the second part also left me sleeping super late to read yet "another page".This book and the House have secured a special place in my heart. Be sure to read it!
4.5 ⭐Holy shit, what an ending... Now we wait...
So far from the series, this is my favorite! It is a true page-turner, something was happening on every page, and I could not stop reading! As it was -probably- my favorite book series as a teenager and my all-time comfort TV show, I am still so in love with this story and this world...
"To try and make people see what is right in front of their eyes: this is core to the history of feminism, as it has been to the history of all human rights struggles.""A feminist is a killjoy, by definition; you kill joy by calling out sexism."No words for this book... It made me angry and hopeful, it made me cry and smile. Every text, every story, every poem touched a part of me.This book is truly an embodiment and proof that Feminism is for Everybody!
As it turned out, I did kill pigs that night after all.What a powerful character and a powerful book. Circe is such a strong and inspiring woman. I will always cherish this book.I absolutely recommend Circe, as -I think- I loved it even more than the Song of Achilles.
... if women can do that, is there any limit to what we can do except the limit we put upon ourselves?Short but great and super informative book!However, it is very sad how the rhetoric against feminism has remained the same throughout the years... "They call it justice and equality. It is nothing of the kind. It is the subjection of man to woman." (taken from an anti-suffragette handbill).
Koning Priam smekend om zijn zoon z’n lichaam, Hector tegen Achilles: ‘Revere the gods, Achilles! Pity me in my own right, remember your own father! I deserve more pity… I have endured what no one on earth has ever done before-I put to my lips the hands of the man who killed my son.’ 1 van de moeilijkste, maar mooiste werken die ik heb gelezen.
Simple but exquisit in giving you eerie, mixed feelings when it comes to imaging living during World War 2. Melodramatic but not too heavy to read. Marga seems a new Anne Frank to me.
Practical, fun and inspiring book when you want to understand your partner better. And of course to find out what your own 'love language' sounds like...
A wonderful book. There is much more to this story than it might seem. A study of free will, is only the tip of the iceberg.
If timetraveling were ever made possible, even in one single string of time, everything is orchestrated by the future.

This perfect piece of high fantasy is set in a magical world that human kingdoms/territories share with ancient, powerful dragons. The relative peace that the humans have enjoyed for the past thousand years seems to be coming to an end now that rumours are being spread of an ancient enemy awakening. The world is divided, though every territory consults their own histories, legends and religions to find a way to fight this overwhelming threat – many eyes are turned towards an island Queendom. It is believed that as long as the Berethnet queens rule, this ancient enemy is shackled, but now the queendom is without an heir. A war is coming.I’m not the biggest fantasy reader, only because I have a specific taste – this high fantasy novel is exactly that taste. The worldbuilding was absolutely phenomenal. Every kingdom is so detailed, with their own histories, religions and stories, with their specific looks and fashion – you can’t help but fully immerse. The story itself is also very compelling: the enemy is great, the tasks they have to complete are exhilarating, the myths come to live are extraordinary. Mostly, I loved how every detail in the end fit together to create this magical whole: I’m going to have to reread it, to fully appreciate all the details Shannon wove together. A fantasy is characterized by the magical world, or mythical beings, but what makes this book so great are the characters. I loved the diversity in characters, not only look-wise but also in their personalities. It was great to read a fantasy where gayness was so extremely normalized, *chef’s kiss*. Shannon has an amazing knack for writing the individual motivations that propel the story forward. Though I did not agree with all the choices’ characters made, Shannon build their context so well, that I could understand why they made the choices that they did. This made it impossible to put the book down.One slight note of criticism, I kind of dislike the dragon Nayimathun. For a novel that was so raw and tragic, the dragon was too overly sweet, and good, and wise. All characters had flaws, except for this one. The dragons might have been seen as gods, but even gods are fallible.
Self-proclaimed psychopath Dorothy Daniels has a long lasting career as a successful food critic. But critiquing restaurant food is not what truly tickles her fancy. More than anything she loves to indulge her most exquisite tastes, seducing her lovers and them cooking them up into the most delicious meal imaginable. And this is her mouthwatering, rich in taste story.My favourite genre of books: fucked women doing fucked up things, leaving me to say one thing only: “I defend women’s rights, and women’s wrongs, good for her.” In a world where women are often made to feel like they have to make themselves small, or apologise for things that are not their doing, it is refreshing to read about a (psychopathic) woman who just goes for what she wants until she gets it. It’s not good that she wants to eat people, but the sentiment is solid. Dorothy is the ultimate girlboss and I love her for it. She was such an interesting character, the chapters about her childhood offered a depth I had not expected in a book that opens with a gruesome murder. Additionally, I loved how she believed so wholeheartedly in her own myth making, that she could not see the mistakes she made and how her arrest was inevitable. This book offers an almost ironic glimpse into the complexity of being a woman, and how men will never see it. If they were not lulled into a sense of false security on the basis of her being a helpless, harmless woman, they might have lived. Not to victim blame, but … what were they wearing?This book was so utterly disgusting at times, but also incredibly sexy and so amazingly funny! I was laughing out loud multiple times, I had so much fun reading this. I’m not a foodie, but the food descriptions were mouthwatering good. Even if the main ingredient was a man’s buttock, give me a taste.
After Dara’s death and Ali’s disappearance, Nahri is forced to forge her own place in the dazzling royal court of Daevabad. Not an easy task now that Nahri has realized that she can trust nobody around her. She has no choice but to fully embrace her heritage and power in order to build a path where she can fully be herself. Exiled for daring to defy his father, Ali is adrift on the unforgiving sands of his ancestral land, hunted by assassins and forced to rely on frightening new abilities that threaten to reveal a terrible family secret. And as a new century approaches and the djinn gather within Daevabad's brass walls to celebrate, a power in the desolate north will bring a storm of fire straight to the city’s gates.I had seen other people say this book was better than the first, and I wholeheartedly agree! Whereas the last book had an underwhelming middle section, this book held the suspense the entire time. It took no effort to keep on reading. The political intrigue was written remarkably well. It was detailed enough to keep my attention, but not to complicated to make it boring. The parallel between Ghassan and Manizheh was established very well. It made the entire plot so tragic: the hero who was supposed to free them all is actually just as bad as the villain. Though, one minor point of criticism, at some point the parallel was kind of beaten to death. It was repeated so often, I think the story would have increased in strength with a little more subtlety. All to say, it was obvious things were about to blow up, yet I was still very surprised with the actual sequence of actions. It was exhillerating, gripping and soooo good! The last 10 chapters especially had me in a chokehold! I could not have guessed a single thing. Love it!As with the last book, my opinions on the characters vary greatly, some I love, some I hate. The one I still hate most is unfortunately the main character... Nahri is so incredibly selfish and self-centred, she still cannot fathom that other people have different experiences and worldviews than her. And that they thus have different opinions, that are not worth less than hers. Most of the time, I was screaming at her to shut up. But, my annoyance was felt less because there were loads of good characters that made up for Nahri. I loved how Zaynab was finally made into an actual character, instead of a caricature of a ‘spoiled princess’. To nobody’s surprise, Ali is still my absolute favorite – I’d die for him. I also very much enjoyed how Dara was given more depth, both as victim and as perpetrator. I was very glad to read that Dara realized that how he treated Nahri was toxic. I’d probably have dnf’d this book if his actions were meant to be read as romantic, I just cannot do that. All in all, I loved this book better than the first. Can’t wait to see how this all ends in book 3!
“I talk about how I did not plant the seeds too deeply, how it was the fault of the earth, the land, of our town. I even think now that the land of the entire country was hostile to marigolds that year. This soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers. Certain seeds it will not nurture, certain fruit it will not bear, and when the land kills of its own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live. We are wrong, of course, but it doesn't matter. It's too late. At least on the edge of my town, among the garbage and the sunflowers of my town, it's much, much too late.”All Pecola Breedlove ever wanted was blue eyes. Pretty blue eyes. Because girls with pretty blue eyes would not have to suffer like ugly girls such as her. Girls with pretty blue eyes don’t have fathers who are dangerously free, and mothers who had to squash their own dreams just to survive. Girls with pretty blue eyes are not abused, bullied nor rejected. Through the lens of childhood friends, Toni Morrison weaves a devastating story about a normal little girl, who never stood a chance in a society who dismisses her outright. I am broken. This was such a tough read. I remember reading this for English when I was 16/17 years old. It definitely had an effect on me back then, but I for sure did not process all of the critique on race, Eurocentric beauty standards and generational trauma that Morrison discusses. I don’t think any 16 year old has the maturity to actually understand, it was good to reread now as an adult. On multiple occasions I had to put the book down and stare into the void. It hit me hard that a book published in 1970 is still as poignant and relevant now. For society, but also for me personally – only recently I’ve been able to fully embrace my natural hair instead constantly wishing to have straight hair.I audibly gasped when the parallels between Claudia/Frieda and Pecola where parallelling. The difference in reaction to Frieda’s harassment to Pecola’s full-blown rape was staggering. It really drove home the point that Pecola was as much a victim of her own assault, as of the abuse that victimized her parents. She never stood a chance, thrust into the laps of parents who cannot even look themselves in the mirror, let alone look at their daughter. Or as Morrison so beautifully put it: “What could his [Cholly’s] heavy arms and befuddled brain accomplish that would earn him his own respect, that would in turn allow him to accept her [Pecola’s] love?” I adore Toni Morrison as a writer, she has such an flowing and easy way of tackling the most horrendous injustices of the world with the utmost respect and understanding. She enters my soul with her words. But I just can’t read another of her books anytime soon, not until this one stops haunting me.
This modern classic gives a stunningly real account of war, and its consequences to those who are ‘forced’ to fight it. Johnny is a young man who was drafted to fight in France during the First World War. While in France, he is hit by a German missile. Unlike his many peers, Johnny survives, but not in a way he wants to survive. He lost all four of his limbs, and his face. He is essentially a consciousness buried alive in his own skin. Now he has no choice but to come face to face with himself (past, present, and future), and think about how he ended up like he did. This is the anti-war book of all ages.I’ve been in a massive reading slump, and this was not the book to read to get out of it. This book is HEAVY, but so damn beautiful. I constantly had tears in my eyes because of the emotive, devasting way of writing. Normally I’m not a huge fan of stream-of-consciousness writing, but here it worked so well. I was transported into the claustrophobic state of mind Johnny was in. Whenever he was taken by the emotional reality of his situation, or whenever he was angry about war, I was too! Johnny’s fight to gain back his sanity while essentially being buried alive in his own skin, and then him gaining back the ability to communicate – nothing has touched me more. Usually I’m good at differentiating between the fictional world of a book and reality, this felt like reading a real life documentary– Dalton Trumbo’s Johnny is all young boys who died in a war they did not understand and did not want to fight. I was already a pacifist, this book surely solidified that standpoint. And of course I loved the communist undertones in it. Normally, I skip the introductions given to a novel, but I read them this time. I’m glad I did. Trumbo’s own 1970 reflection (book was published in 1939) gave an eye-opening context. I can 100% understand how this book became a rallying point for the counterculture of the 60ies during the Vietnam War. This book brilliantly argues how the war industry emotionally manipulates young people to fight in the name of vague, yet societally imposed moral points, such as ‘freedom’/’democracy’ – and it makes no sense. Still today, this point is so important. War is never okay, and fighting wars with the lives of innocent young people makes everything so much worse. Reading this I couldn’t help think about the thousands of lives already lost this year in Iran, Afghanistan, Ukraine and so many more countries with endless conflicts. This book emotionally drained me, but I do highly recommend it. It’s just beautiful. “It will be you – you who urge us on to battle you who incite us against ourselves … you who would have one human being who wants only to live kill another human being who wants only to live. Remember this. Remember this well you people who plan for war. … Remember this as you have never remembered anything else in your lives.”
This novella is about the aftermath of the war against the King of Hybern. Rhys, Feyre, Nesta, Elain and all the other members of the Night Court prepare to celebrate their first … together. Essentially, this book establishes the end of the Feyre/Rhys storyline and the beginning of the Nesta/Cassian one. If you don’t have to, don’t read this book.This book was infuriating but also so utterly boring, I completely forgot what I read the moment I put the book down. Flipping through the pages again, and the anger I felt while reading is awakened again. Probably don’t have to mention how annoying the constant use of the word: ‘mate’ was – the possessiveness is not cute. Other than the possessiveness, Feyre and Rhys are too perfect to be interesting characters. He is the most powerful High Lord, she is the first High Lady and they have all the money in the world. There is no interesting strive anymore. perfection = boring. New to this book is the other POVs, I wanted to like them but just couldn’t. It is already established that Maas is not good at writing a convincing ‘strong and independent’ woman *cough* Feyre *cough*; and now we know that she is also not good at writing men, oh sorry, ‘males’. The nonstop objectification of all females they see is just absolutely disgusting. And the constant horniness, that the others can smell? Please, God, no. It also seems as if is Maas is using sex in lieu of an actual relationship between characters: Feyre and Rhys hardly seem to communicate about anything other than sex – they are so one dimensional with a flat relationship between them. Honestly, I really do not like Nesta – because of how she treated human Feyre, and because of how incredibly possessive she is of Elain. I’m not particular excited to read a book from her point of view, but honestly it cannot get more boring than this. One more book to go, and I’m never going to read a Maas book ever again.
I had this book recommended to me, with the words: “it’s a book Western Europe must read to understand how unfairly we have treated refugees”. I completely agree.This is one of those books that I read in a rapid speed, the language is easily accessible, yet surprisingly evocative. On more than one occasion I had to stop reading, because the image portrayed was too intense. Many of the scenarios described (like the twin boys), I already knew about through the news, but this book truly brought the devastation to life. I loved the way in which the story of their stay in England was interwoven with the story of their journey through the pages that both form the end of one passage and the beginning of another. The tangible pages symbolize that such a journey stays with them, even after finding a place in a new country. Though sometimes I struggled with keeping track of the timeline. Pretty early on, it became that the story has two distinctive narrative layers that are dependent on each other, but clearly different from each other. The outer layer is about the realities of being a refugee. This layer is violent on the physical level. The inner layer is about the grief that comes along with war, fleeing your home and the loss of belonging and family members. It is this layer that almost invoked more violence to me. Nuri and Afra both illustrate how grief can be manifested differently, through physical blindness or mental resignation. Stories like this make me infinitely grateful for the life I have in a safe country.
This (sort-of) stand alone novel focuses on Nesta’s life after the war against Hybern. Nesta got out of that war severely impacted by all that had happened to her. Obviously, suffering from depression and PTSD, she is drowning herself into destructive pleasures. Instead of trying to actually talk to her, and help her – the members of the Night Court send her away so that she can be ugly depressed somewhere else. Cassian goes with her, and then they fuck, A LOT. Slowly, but surely Nesta gets over her depression, with the help of her newly acquired friends. Meanwhile, there is this boring plot about the Dread Troves and that one human-turned-crone Queen who wants to get back to power?I did it. I read all 2500+ pages of this shit: feel like I’ve climbed Mt. Everest. I’m never ever picking up a Maas’ book again. This book was an awful ending to an awful journey. Starting out, I really did not like Nesta for all the annoying shit she pulled in previous books, but I gotta stick up for my girl: why was everybody so incredibly nasty to her? You would think that all these warriors who know how a war can impact you, that they would have more compassion for a girl who saw her dad killed in front of her. Maas tells us that if you are depressed in a way that seems ugly to your family/friends, you deserve to be punished :). Additionally, again (Tamlin vs. Rhys) it feels as if Maas has to make everyone a stereotypical villain, for the love interest to stand out. Like, if the Night Court ‘inner circle’ wasn’t so mean, Cassian would not have stood out as ‘understanding’. It really reeks of weak characterization, and weakly established interpersonal relationships. Other than them needing each other for (sexual) release, I don’t see how Nesta and Cassian are apparently so in love…?I was pleasantly surprised that ‘mate’ was not excessively used this novel. The pleasantries ceased when it became clear that all the males reduce literally every female in literally any situation into a sexualized object. It was truly disgusting. And why is everybody able to smell when someone is turned on and/or had sex? And why is everybody so chill about it? It’s absolutely mortifying. I truly cannot do this anymore. Maas is like the modern day Stephenie Meyer: a bad writer who is kind of problematic... I'm so glad i finished, and that I never have to do this again.
Unlike the previous two books, this is the first actual novel with one overarching story. The book starts a year after the fall of the Kingdom of Cintra by the hands of Nilfgaard. Princess Cirrila, is left without a family nor a kingdom. Although she has escaped the Nilfgaardian clutches of the Emperor, she is still being pursued by many a spy. Luckily, Geralt takes her to his home base Kaer Morhen, where she will be raised and protected by the witchers. When sorceress Triss Merigold shows up, they realise Ciri is more than they could have ever imagined. And hiding her from the world is no longer an option. Carefully they travel through war torn lands to get her to the Temple of Melitele where she can safely grow and learn under the watchful eyes of Yennefer and Mother Nenneke. Or so they hope, Nilfgaard is not going to give up. This book is way more complicated than the previous two. This book was so hard to understand at times, the political world was so confusing. Partially, because I had no way to orient myself – I desperately needed a map and an outline of who belongs to what kingdom. Thank God for the fan wiki. In the end, it was just a matter of pushing through, and eventually the pieces fell into place enough for me to understand what was going on. The characters are still as compelling as before (Triss Merigold, and the other witchers!). This is the first book that I felt like I really got to know Ciri, and I love her. She is such a well written child. She is clearly young, which makes her say or do things that are stupid in adult eyes. Those moments are never portrayed as annoying. Sapkowski clearly respects her as a fully fledged character. I appreciated that. Her bond with Geralt is to die for. The way she defends him to a fault is the cutest thing ever. Ciri and Yen have a similar spot in my heart. Yennefer comes to live in relation to Ciri. Her need to leave a positive mark in the world is so beautifully captured in the relationship she has with Ciri. Her calling Ciri ‘daughter’ for the first time, ugh my heart. ‘Parents’ actually being emotionally available to their children is my kryptonite, I did cry. This is also why this book is my favourite so far.
‘People like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem les monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they killed a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live.’I had previously watched the first season of the Netflix show, so I thought I knew what to expect from Geralt as a character. And yes, he is brooding, emotionally stand-offish with a strong ethical code, but the show completely missed out on how funny he is! I audibly giggled at his dry remarks at stupid people. And, maybe even more importantly, the show does not do justice to sweet he is to those more vulnerable than him. His ‘friendship’ with Jaskier in the show was awful to watch, in the books I love him with Dandelion. I honestly love Geralt so much. This is a great fantasy series if you love beautiful character driven stories with interesting monsters, and gripping scenes of action. I also exceptionally enjoyed how some monsters/stories were clearly inspired by well-known European fairytales, but Sapkowski repackaged them in such a way that the tropes felt fresh and new again. Because the book drops you in the middle of an unknown fantasy world, it took me some time to get into the world, having watched the show previously did help with that. I’m very much a ‘world-building is very important’ type of girly, so it did bother me that the world was only slowly revealed. But since the book is very much character driven, it is not that important for the story itself just for my personal enjoyment. All in all, this was a good way to end another year of reading.
I think I have to retire the idea that books don’t make me cry, this one got me good! This book, of itself, already packs a heavy emotional punch, but reading this when the Taliban just got back into power in Afghanistan and millions of Ukrainians are currently fleeing their cities; the narrative of living in war hits even harder. Despite the brutal violence and pain described throughout, this story is essentially a beautiful account of the power of hope and women’s perseverance. How light and love can survive and grow even in the darkest of times. The writing style completely sucked me in. I’ve never been to Afghanistan, but it truly felt like I was there. The city, it’s sounds, smells, colors, I experienced them all. The full immersion did not let up during the violent scenes, I found myself screaming at the book multiple times. I also felt a strong connection to the Miriam and Laila. They were such full and complex characters with their own hopes and dreams. Miriam’s story particularly got to me, how she despite everything that was done to her survived and even thrived, absolutely admirable. The themes (war, domestic abuse, Islam, misogyny) covered were handled in a delicate manner. The reality of being a woman in Kabul during that time was described realistically, without a specific politicized point of view. This book reminds me of Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Both novels gave me more insight into the violent chapter of a country through the eyes of the people actually living that reality. This is an absolute gem of a novel. It’s for sure going to be on my favorites list.
She might be somewhat lost in history, but in this book Helen Hollick makes a strong case for Queen Emma being one of the most fascinating queens in English history. Set in the 11th century, this book follows the life story of Emma: from her marriage to the ineffectual and cruel King Æthelred, to her being Queen Mother to two sons who were crowned in quick succession for the same throne. Her life was far from easy, it made her strong, smart and ruthless and most importantly fond of the power that came with her crown. Time passes, kings die, political alliances shift but Emma survives and fights to stay a queen and woman in her own rights.A few weeks ago I read Hollick’s other book of this series: “I am the Chosen King” - I absolutely loved that book, it was everything I wanted out of a historical fiction. I was very excited to read this book too, this excitement lasted for the first 300 pages of this 600 page book. The last 300 pages I was kind of bored. I get that this book is based on history, but I have to say: the story got incredibly repetitive: there is a king, oh no the king dies, civil war to get a new king, there is a king… rinse and repeat. The repetitiveness would not have bothered me as much, if the characterization of the main players was a little more detailed. Especially Alfred and Edward (sons of Æthelred ) were awfully written. They came across like little children, even when they were supposedly in their thirties. Although I like Emma as a character, she is slightly one dimensional.Nevertheless, I liked the world building in this novel. The buildings and clothes, nature and weather, sound and smell of 11th century England were beautifully described - it truly felt like I was part of all the proceedings. Still, the overall language and writing style of this book isn’t very good. The sentences are often confusing, the story line is at times hard to follow with time and place jumps almost every chapter. This is absolutely not Hollick’s fault, but the names are a nightmare. I often lost track of who did what where and why. I’m happy to have finished this series, but if I’m ever going to reread it, I’m gonna stick to “I am the Chosen King.”
After the death of King Robert Baratheon and the beheading of noble Ned Stark, all the stability the realm has known has disappeared. Under the light of a red comet kings are popping up left and right throughout the realm. Joffrey in Kings Landing, Stannis Baratheon in the Stormlands, Renly with the power of the Reach, Robb in the North and Balon Greyjoy on the Iron Islands. While the war is being fought, Arya is trying to get back to Winterfell and Sansa discovers the true nature of the Lannisters. In the North, Jon travels beyond the wall and sees that something sinister is stirring. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys takes her tiny khalasar to Qarth in search of ways to take her rightful spot on the Iron Throne. “A Clash of Kings” is such an exciting continuation of the set up of “A Game of Thrones”. After the death of the supposed ‘main character’, the stakes feel infinitely higher in this novel – no one is safe. Additionally, it becomes clear that the growing magic is a dangerous. Even though I already knew what was going to happen, I was still so shocked by the death of Renly. This is also the novel through which George truly shows how good he is in writing characters, for example Stannis’ reaction to Renly’s death is so tragic and human. The characterization elevates this book from a just fantasy to a brilliant analysis of human nature. Though I do not enjoy all POVs equally, I honestly struggle to get through Catelyn’s chapters, I understand why she behaved towards Jon like she did but it still leaves a too bitter taste in my mouth. I will forever and always be a Sansa girly and a Tyrion apologist just because I feel for his need to gain love and approval. Beside the excellent characterization, this novel shows it’s strength through the interconnectedness of all storylines. Westeros is massive, Daenerys is not even on the continent yet it is abundantly clear that all characters are playing on the same chess board. Again, whatever George writes, I will EAT. IT. UP!!!
This novel puts forward a vision of the future where the consumption of animal meat is no longer possible because of a life threatening disease. To fulfil the need for meat, ‘society’ has decided to start the consumption of human meat. It as if society has flipped a mental switch; some humans are people and some humans are products for consumption – it is disgusting, eerie and described in a way that feels uncomfortably real. The story is told through the eyes of the introverted Marcos Tejo. He has gone through a lot in his personal life: losing his infant son; splitting with his wife due to their different methods of grieving; and caring for his demented father. All the while he works in one of the biggest factories providing society with its need for (human) meat. One day he is gifted one female, who was bred to be eaten – what is he going to do with this gift?Wow. This is a novel unlike any other I’ve read before. It was disgusting, wild, but amazing. It felt as if I was holding my breath the entire time while reading – the story had me in its grips. Without giving spoilers, the ultimate twist at the ending of the story felt like a massive gut punch. And looking back to the story, I should have felt it coming. Through his internal dialogue, Marcos tries to put himself forward as different, better than the rest (especially his sister). He makes it seem as if it is more difficult for him than for others to do his job, but he still does it. He seeks the moral high ground, without actually deserving it – he is an integral part of the disgusting society he says he hates. This moral ambiguity combined with the at times unreliable narration (about himself) makes this an exciting read. When I read other people’s reviews, I thought this book would be more action packed than it is. The story progresses in a slow pace, but this slow pace forces you to look more closely at the horror of what is happening. At the same time, I did read this book in a rapid pace – the story is compelling, if with your stomach turning you want to know what happens next. At times, I did struggle with the writing style, especially the dialogues were occasionally difficult to follow. But this small hiccup was nothing compared to the brilliance of the overall story. This is not a book that should be recommended to just anyone due to the subject, but damn, it was good!
The Seven Kingdoms: a kingdom solely held together under the authority of the King Robert Baratheon. Since the civil war that ed to his ascendance to the throne, the kingdom has known reluctant peace. Established, old noble houses do not easily forget the suffering brought upon them by those in power. To keep the peace, Robert travels to the North to asks his politically stable friend Eddard 'Ned' Stark to help him rule. The moment the King arrives at the ancestral castle of the starks, consequences are set in motion that will forever alter the kingdom entirely. House against House, family against family, with a sprinkle of ominous magic. This novel (series) is the epitome of High Fantasy.Rereading this felt so nostalgic to me. I was immediately transported back to high school when I would secretly read under my desk during class. This novel is just as good, maybe even better the second time as it was the first. Nobody creates an intricate, detailed and complicated world with fully fledged interesting characters like George R.R. Martin does. Westeros is grounded enough in recognizable medieval culture to be understood, and simultaneously so magical to create an fantastical world never seen before. And as with all books I’ve been rereading 10 years later, i realized that I had missed out on so many brilliant details. Especially striking was the constant foreshadowing you can’t see unless you know what happens next. This just comes to show how well of a planner and writer George is. If he writes it, I will eat it up. And it has to be said, the first season of the show perfectly tells the story of this first book.Though the story is absolutely brilliant, there are a few aspects that are less than great. Namely the amount of casual sexual violence. More than once, sexual assault is used as character development for women, instead of as the pure trauma that it is. And sure, sexual violence is a reality but to write almost all male characters as rape apologists at best and in the worst case as active predators is less than great. Saying this might mean I have to relinquish my feminist batch, but I can overlook this fault because the rest more than makes up for it.
This hauntingly beautiful book reimagines the story about the Trojan War. Although this story is already so widely known, this book feels fresh and new. I already knew the ending, yet this book had me sitting on the edge of my seat, praying for Patroclus and Achilles survival. The story starts with Patroclus exile, and his subsequent childhood in Achilles’ father kingdom. In a language that feels incredibly poetic, you’re there when Achilles and Patroclus grow up from boys to men. You’re there when their relationship moves from close friendship, to soulmate love. And then the war starts. War has the power to bring out the ugly side of people, and so also Patroclus and Achilles clash with each other. In a sequence of well intended, but stupid choices they lead themselves to their tragic end. You cannot help but cry, and hope that they find each other in death.It is so refreshing to read about a gay love story. It is common to “straight-wash” history, we need to be reminded that gay love was common at the time of the Greek heroes. What makes it even more beautiful, is that their love is subtle yet the core of their entire story together. Not once do Patroclus and Achilles explicitly say that they love each other, but as a reader you know that they do. It was palpable in every choice they made. Additionally, for such a traditionally male story focused on masculine traits and violence, the story does not feel overly violent. Miller does not shy away from telling truth about the lives of slaves, and the horrors of war. But the Greeks are not just described warriors, they are fully formed men with hopes, dreams, and intricate emotions. They are human. It makes the story so much more tragic. As a reader you know these men, and then they die. This book has to get 4 stars. It’s not often that I cry when reading, and damn did I cry. The language transported me to Greece, I was there with Chiron, I could smell the decay in the fields before Troy. Most importantly, I felt love, and it was beautiful.
What a wonderful, inspiring and moving book this was. I most certainly learned from this book, and I feel like I could come back to it in difficult times. Although I read this book slower than I read novels, I could not put it down. I thought about it throughout my day, and this book actually made me cry full tears. This books makes me want to be more grounded, to stop running from pain and fully embrace myself. This book makes me want to work, spiritually. I highly recommend this book!
At 28 years old, Penelope was now officially a spinster. And for the past 10 years she has secretly adored her best friend’s brother: Colin Bridgerton. Colin who has been a constant in her life, for forever, and yet he still somehow surprises her. Does she know him as well as she thinks she does? After extensive traveling, Colin has returned to London. Nothing is as he left it, especially Penelope Featherington. The girl who was always simply there is suddenly the girl haunting his dreams. Is there promise of a happy ending for them?This has been by far my favourite Bridgerton book yet. I absolutely adore Penelope. I enjoyed how surprisingly relatable she was. But I absolutely loved how she has a sense of agency I felt was lacking with the other women in the previous Bridgerton books. She is her own person, with her own achievements through which she has this admirable sense of self. Colin as her husband is just the perfect cherry on top. And what a cherry he is, I adore him too. Even when they were fighting, it was so evident that he cares about her in a way that he can’t even comprehend. Additionally, I really enjoyed Lady Danbury this book. She is one formidable woman and I want to be like her when I grow up. Loved how she supported Penelope through her rights and wrongs, adorable. All previous Bridgerton books followed a similar storytelling set up, with comparable pacing. This book was different, which was a pleasant surprise. Instead of just storytelling about the ‘marriage chase’ culminating in the wedding, Penelope and Colin’s story offered a wonderful glimpse into their married life. It allowed for more character development which I felt was lacking in the previous books. I decidedly did NOT enjoy the overused parentheses. They gave me war-flashbacks to Olivie Blake’s Atlas Six trilogy. That is a crime. Though, I am afraid that this is the best book of the entire series, and that it will only will go downhill from here. Only one way to find out…
Normally I start my reviews with a little plot summary, for this book that is not so easy. The book is divided up into 6 little story arcs, set in the same world with the same set of characters. In all honesty, it’s been a month since reading this book so I don’t remember the individual stories anymore. I do remember that I loved every single one of them. It was just a very fun fantasy read. Reading this was like watching a 6 episodes miniseries. It introduces you to this world, the characters, the magic system, etc. in a very low key way. I love fantasy books, but sometimes they are impossible to understand – I did not have that problem with this book/world. I loved it.What I especially loved about the writing style, is how subtly Sapkowski foreshadows the plot of the character arcs. Now that I have read more books in the series, I can more fully appreciate how Geralt’s character arc was already beautifully set up in this second part of the series. Throughout the story you grow with the characters, you have the same realizations as the characters. Although the world is fictious, the characters feel so incredibly real. Even the women feel real – I can see that Sapkowski has a progressive understanding of feminism. Though, there are a still a few misogynist moments, which I don’t mind too much because it fits into the feudal system the world is set in.Like I said before, I have watched the Netflix show, and did not like it. The show butchers the books. The thing that is butchered the most, is the love story between Geralt and Yennefer. I had no idea that Geralt and Yennefer were supposed to like each other. Let alone be in love!!! I honestly thought they hated each other. Now I get it, and I ship them wholeheartedly. The chapter about Istredd and Geralt fighting over her and then Yennefer choosing herself over any man?!? Yes girl, I’m screaming crying throwing up, I love it so much. The characters alone make me so hyped to read the rest of this fantastic series.
Twenty years after a mysterious disease has decimated the human population and has destroyed life as we know it, the Travelling Symphony travels around the country formerly known as the USA to perform Shakespeare in the small settlements of survivors. During such one visit, they come into contact with a group under the leadership of The Prophet. This unfortunate meeting snowballs into a situation that again threatens life as they know it. What will they do to preserve and protect the humanity they so carefully gathered up among the world’s ruin. This book follows several different perspectives, all in their own timeline – one shows how the world collapsed, while another shows how people survive in its wreckage and lastly there is a storyline from before the world ended. At first, it took me some time to appreciate every individual storyline, and how they connected to the world at large. Once that clicked, my god this book was brilliant! I’ve previously read her more recent book Sea of Tranquillity, and it is obvious that Mandel elaborated on the concepts of this book to write Sea of Tranquillity. That is also why I prefer that one over Station Eleven, it is clear that she had more experience writing that book. Nonetheless, I loved it. Mandel has a way of writing such raw humanity, like how humans are forced by their DNA to survive. And it is that need for survival that brings beauty but also pain. And Mandel describes it in such a way that is easy to understand, yet grander than anything else I’ve read before. You truly can’t help but be swept away by it. There are so many characters in this book, and usually I’m not the best at remembering every name and every backstory. But the characters are introduced in such a way, that I did not struggle at all. And even though, many characters have only a few pages written about them, none of them felt empty. Which is really impressive. There is one character that felt off compared to the others, The Prophet. In a way he almost seemed like a caricature of a cult leader. But in comparision to all the good of this book, this is just one minor little hiccup. If Emily St. John Mandel writes another book, I’m reading it.
I bought this book years ago, but never came around to reading it. Somehow it never fully grabbed my attention. Now that I’ve read it I’m glad I did, but it’s definitely not the best book I’ve ever read. Harrison as the main character and narrator was very charming! Without mentioning spoilers, but the ending was tragic but felt kind of forced to me. Especially after the elated chapter before… This book wasn’t a miss, but wasn’t a complete hit either
A few weeks before I read The Underground Railroad, and while it covers important topics, the story felt to fictionalized to pack a strong punch. The punch in this book hit me a lot harder. Elwood’s naivety turning into despair was so subtly, yet clearly written. It definitely drew me in, and made me reflect on the privileges of my own life, And the gut punch of Griff’s tragic disappearance had me in tears: angry for all people that suffered such a fate. Whitehead definitely has a knack for writing stories about topics that should be public knowledge, but sadly isn’t yet. Although I definitely enjoyed this book better than The Underground Railroad, I have come to the conclusion that I’m not a big fan of Whiteheads style of writing. Quite often I had to read sentences again, somehow the structure he uses doesn’t hold my attention. I also struggled with the passages set later in time, I did not entirely grasp the point of then, until the big reveal. Because of these reasons I cannot give this book a higher rating than 4 stars.
While Denmark is preparing to fight an invasion by Norway, Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his freshly deceased dad. Ghost dad asks Hamlet to avenge him by killing his killer, who so happens to be his brother and new king Claudius – Claudius not only stole the late king’s throne, but also his wife. Burdened by the heavy task of killing his uncle-father, Hamlet feigns (??) madness, contemplates life and death, and breaks the heart of his lover Ophelia. Meanwhile, Claudius is also plotting, plotting to murder Hamlet. In true Shakespearean fashion plots get twisted, people are at the wrong place at the wrong time and there is no way that the story can end in a way wherein everyone is happy.I can’t believe it took me this long to read this. I loved both Othello and The Tempest, so I had high hopes for this. Every single one of my expectations was surpassed, this was magnificent. I loved every single line of this play. Obviously, reading a play is different from seeing it, but I was very much immersed into the story. Stage directions are not very descriptive, but I could fully imagine the atmosphere in which these characters move. I loved the moodiness, and the angst, but also the absurdism of it all. I don’t know how Shakespeare does it, but he is somehow able to make a very heavy subject incredibly funny. I mean, look at how the guards react to seeing the ghost for the first time. (view spoiler)[ Or how Laertes gets stabbed by his own poisoned sword (hide spoiler)] – No thoughts, just chaotic vibes. Yet simultaneously, Hamlet’s reflections are incredibly clever. Of course I had heard of the famous “to be, or not to be” quote, but I had no idea that the entire passage was so beautiful and thought out. I do have to admit that I did occasionally google the meaning of a particular scene. And I’d have to read this again to actually form intelligent thoughts about this play. For now, I just really enjoyed this. Now I need to see Hamlet in an actual theatre.
** spoiler alert ** Whereas “A Feast for Crows” focused on mid and south Westeros, “A Dance with Dragons” focuses on the East and the North. The East storylines converge on Daenerys in Meereen. Dany is desperately trying to hold on to power. She quickly learns that gaining power and holding it are completely different things, it forces her to make difficult lifechanging decisions. Meanwhile she is utterly unaware of both Quentyn and Victarion racing towards her to use their in their own political plots. They are not the only people traveling, after his trial Tyrion was forced to leave Westeros behind. On his journey he is accompanied by two peculiar travellers who appear to be more than they say. Up in the North, Jon is struggling to bind together two groups who have hated each other for centuries, so they can fight the common enemy: The Others. Bran has reached the Three Eyed Raven, but things are not what he thought they would be. Ramsay has tortured Theon/Reek into total submission and Cersei has got herself in imprisoned – things are happening.Another fantastic read! Though, I did enjoy this one less than the previous book purely because I do not like Daenerys. She is too full of herself for a young girl/woman who literally has no idea what she is doing – the Targaryen name does not make a ruler. All other chapters totally make up for it, though. And honestly, I’m still so shocked by the entire Young Griff storyline, with Connington ending up with greyscale? Gooped and gagged, I thought I had experienced all sorts of shock but somehow George pulled another one out of the bag. And Quentyn’s storyline? Good lord, I should not be surprised that important characters are being killed off (I remember Eddard) but this was brutal in an unexpected way. And now all I can do is pray that eventually, one day we are going to be blessed with the 6th and god willing, the 7th book of the series. Hopes are low, but a girl can dream.
“There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will. Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day. It is always the same shape, only very numerous. … I wish John would take me away from here!”This little book contains three short stories written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. The first, ‘The Yellow Wall-Paper’ chronicles a young mother’s descent into psychosis. In short, the woman’s husband, Doctor John, is of the opinion that her depressive nervousness (post-partum depression?) can be helped by putting her on ‘rest-therapy’. She takes this therapy in a strange room, with ugly yellow wallpaper. Because she has nothing to do all day, she puts all of her thoughts and energy towards the wallpaper. Soon enough the wallpaper becomes more than what it is, and Ellen gets lost into it. The second story, ‘The Rocking-Chair’ follows two young men who, while looking for rooms to rent, see a beautiful young girl in a rocking chair looking down on them. They decide to rent rooms in the same house. Both of them are entirely enamoured with her, and would do anything to catch her in the flesh. This proves to be the most difficult task, made more complicated because nothing appears to be what it seems. The last story, ‘Old Water’ starts with a mother trying to find a romantic, poetic husband for her pragmatic daughter. While romantic love does not link the poet and Ellen together, their dreams and fears apparently do. All three stories were so impressive, and eerie in their own way. I picked up this book because I’ve been wanting to read ‘The Yellow Wall-Paper’ for some time. It did not disappoint, I was so infuriated by the complete disregard Dr. John had towards his wife's mental wellbeing. Of course, she goes crazy when she has literally nothing to do but think. In a few short pages it truly brings home the point that women should be in charge of their own (mental) health, and that they should be listened to. The themes of this story fitted nicely together with the themes of ‘Old Water’. Both women were not seen as the complete individuals they are. Whereas The Yellow Wall-Paper was a tragic story, I found ‘Old Water’ so funny. The Poet truly did get what was coming for him, he could’ve saved himself if he would have just let go of his romantic projections he put onto Ellen. Honestly, this story made me say ‘good for her’. Lastly, ‘The Rocking-Chair’ fits nicely with the Poet. All three men could not see beyond the idea they had of a women. If they had just talked to each other for one second, instead of being jealous, they too would have had a happy ending. Though, this story is my least favourite of the three, I did not particularly care for the (almost) supernatural element of the girl. I wanted to know if she was real or just a figment of their imagination. But conclusively, Charlotte manages to put forward a clear point of view in such short stories that speaks for the emancipation of the woman. I can totally see how her work has been noted as early feminist works. I bet that if I reread these stories, I can find more brilliant details I missed the first time around. I loved it.
In our world where currently Neo-Nazis and right wing extremists are rapidly gaining political ground, this is a book everybody should read. This book will firmly ground you back into the reality of racism in the UK and also racism at large in all former-colonial powers. As a biracial, black identifying woman this was a tough read, though. All the violence, injustice and pain experienced by black people in the UK feels incredibly personal. On top of that, the chapter on the intersection between racism and feminism throws another heavy layer on top. No matter how rich, educated or simply lucky I am, I’m always gonna have strikes against me for reasons I cannot do anything about. To be entirely honest about this book, it is difficult to write a review about it. I can’t write a review like I would about a novel, because this is not some story. This is real life. Real life that I too experience. The sentiment Reni has put behind the title is not only understandable, but also admirable. It is not a crime to choose yourself over the unending uphill battle against willfully ignorant white people. So in that line of reasoning, I’m choosing to keep my innermost feelings to myself. What I can and will say is that this book is incredibly important and eye opening, absolutely deserving of a 5 star rating. It’s a book I’m going to be recommending to people for a long time to come, and hopefully they are all going to read it.
This novel is set in Nazi Germany, starting in 1939 and ending in 1943. The story is narrated by Death, who normally doesn’t bother with humans, but because he crosses paths with Liesel multiple times he decides to follow her. After the death of her little brother, Liesel is brought under with her foster parents living on Hummel street, Monichen - later on they also take in a Jewish refugee. Living there, Liesel has to find her way with friendship, love, loss and growing up, while also facing the reality of living in Nazi Germany. To escape from it all, Liesel becomes a book thief and hides in the power of words. This book is almost unanimously regarded as a modern classic and masterpiece, and unfortunately I have to strongly disagree. Throughout reading this book, I struggled keeping my stank face in check. I have a lot of qualms. First off, I generally don’t enjoy books about WWII, it’s such an overused and difficult topic. This book doesn’t offer a new perspective, on the contrary even it relied on bland stereotypes. I felt bored with it. Secondly, why is it narrated by Death, who has an insufferable personality and the constant need to interrupt the flow of the story? I actually didn’t care about any of the characters of the book, which completely destroys all ‘emotional’ bits. Thirdly, I very much disliked that nothing actually happens to Liesel: she has such a neat/perfect storyline it destroys any sense of war realism. I just couldn’t get in to it.Additionally, the set up of the book annoyed me greatly. The ‘book’ pages were almost impossible to read, and in my opinion, entirely unnecessary - it felt like an interruption. And why did every chapter/new section have those bold passages, again it felt like an interruption. The book is also filled to the brim with sayings that (I guess) are meant to be meaningful/emotional/deep, they just feel lame and ‘live-love-laugh’-like. Zusak appears to think that every little (emotional) detail has to be spelled out entirely, this leaves no room for interpretation by the reader - annoying. And don’t get me started on the gimmicky wat all characters speak: why do they all use the same handful of curses? No thank you, this book isn’t it.
** spoiler alert ** The novel picks up after the battle of Blackwater Bay. Stannis is defeated, Tyrion miraculously survives and King Joffrey is able to hold on to the throne a little longer. Meanwhile, Jamie is escorted back to Kings Landing by Brienne of Tarth, so he can keeps his oath to Catelyn, to return her daughters. Sansa is still held by Cersei and Arya is captured by a ragtag bunch of outlaws. Bran, believed to have been killed, travels towards the wall to find the Three Eyed Raven. Already North of the Wall, Jon is tasked with infiltrating the enemy, the wildlings. In the Far East, Danearys needs to find an army in order to conquer Westeros – she is confronted with Slaver’s Bay where they, surprisingly, keep slaves. Pressures are rising, war is ongoing and the people are suffering.The third book of this series is arguably the most action packed: red and purple wedding, Tyrion’s trial and Tywin’s death, the betrayal of Mormont, death of Lysa Arryn and the arrival of one of my favourite characters: Lady Stoneheart. And yet, this is my least favourite book. I love intrigue, character development, seeing the same event from different perspectives leading to different conclusions. So obviously, Tyrion’s trial is the highlight of this book! Other than that, this book is clearly action over character. Though, this book is the perfect set up for more in depth character study, which spoiler, does actually happen in the next novel: “A Feast for Crows”. Because of the fast pace, this was a very enjoyable book to read. The action is coming at you so fast, I got whiplash. The Red Wedding still hits as hard as it did the first time around. George my man, you done did it again.
From the outside the narrator of this book has an uncommonly privileged life: she has a big inheritance, she got educated at an Ivy league school, she is pretty and thin. Yet, she is incredibly unsatisfied. With the death of her parents, with her only and overbearing friend Reva, and her on-and-off douche boyfriend Trevor. Her one solution to these problem is to sleep it all away. For a year. With the ‘help’ of a disorganized and overindulgent doctor, she acquires the meds that allow her to self-medicate into oblivion. Sleep will fix everything. Ottessa Moshfegh is slowly becoming one of my favourite authors. Her way of writing about women really speaks to me. Unlike many women in other books, Moshfegh’s women are so entirely grounded in reality – they are flawed, gross, struggling, often unlikeable and therefore incredibly relatable. So relatable in fact that certain passages could have been written about me. I, too, often wish I could sleep away everything and anything that makes my life more difficult but I don’t know how to fix. The way the depression at the core of this novel is described was heart wrenching and a little too familiar for comfort. Though I tore through this book, there were moments I just had to put it down because it touched something in me I had safely tucked away. This self-identification with the main character was only enhanced by the fact that she is never named, she could be anybody, she could be me. In other words, this book is great. Like I said, I love Moshfegh’s writing, but secretly I was very glad that this book wasn’t as gross as Lapvona. Of course, it did include some explicit gross bodily functions, like her shitting on the floor of an art gallery, but it fit well enough into the story that it did not distract me. And to be honest, I can’t fault her for doing that – I support women’s rights and also women’s wrongs. The thing that really drew me in was the characters orbiting the main character, like Reva and Trevor. Especially Reva was interesting, Moshfegh carefully constructed a parallel that fully clicked in place and showed its brilliance in the last 10% of the book – absolutely amazing. Once I’m recovered enough, I’d love to go back and explore that parallel even further. The only thing that I truly did not get, was the endless references to American pop culture of the 2000s. Only one in five mentioned movies rung a bell for me. I don’t get the obsession with Whoopi. In that sense, this book was aggressively American. The ease with which she could acquire such heavy drugs…? Laughs in European. That’s the only reason this book is not a 5/5 for me.
This classic piece of American literature follows the coming-of-age-story of Jean Louise ‘Scout’ Finch, and her brother Jeremy Atticus ‘Jem’ Finch. Set in the southern town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression, Jem and Scout are the children of a middle class lawyer, Atticus. During a tumultuous summer Atticus acts as the lawyer for Tom Robinson, a black young men accused of raping white Mayella Ewell. In a community where the Civil War is still fresh, and black people are structurally mistreated, it comes as a shock when Atticus wholeheartedly fights for Tom’s rights. As young, growing children Jem and Scout are thrown in a fraught time on the precipice of great social change. The story is told from Scout’s perspective.I’ve been on a mission to read as many transformative classics as possible, ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ falls perfectly in that category. Because this is such a highly acclaimed novel, I had great expectations for it. Firstly, I was very surprised to learn that this book is written by a woman, I don’t know why but for the longest time I was convinced Harper Lee was a middle-aged white man. It was nice to read this book from the perspective of a unconventional, tom-boy girl. It took me a second to get used to the sentence structure, but after the first 50 pages this book read incredibly fast. This is a cute, transformative and emotional coming-of-age-story.Yet, I can only give this book 3 stars, and that is because I was slightly bored while reading. Nothing particularly captured my attention, the main emotion I felt was annoyance for the ‘white saviour’ narrative on which the book is build. I get that this is a classic novel, and I understand how this novel became to be a masterpiece immediately after its publishing. It definitely deserves its spot in the canon of American literature. From a historical perspective, this book holds a lot of value, but from a anti-racist standpoint I do not think that the message of this book holds up in contemporary discussions on race/racism. Nowadays there are many books with strong anti-racist messages (written by POC) that do not use a ‘white saviour’ narrative. This was an alright book to read, but I would not recommend it to people interested in anti-racist literature.
“It was no use saying [the slave trade] was an unholy or unchristian occupation. It was a lucrative trade, and that was enough. … When British capitalism depended on the West Indies, they ignored slavery or defended it."This study by Eric William, who later became Trinidad and Tobago’s first prime minister, effectively illustrates the deep running connection between the economy of the British Empire and slavery. He argues that the racism inherent to slavery was rather a by-product of the mercantilism aggressively pursued by Britain. In short, slavery was a system brought into existence, and kept alive because of the mercantilist monopoly the West Indies had on the production of raw sugar for the British Empire. The plantation owners used their acquired wealth to buy the political power necessary to solidify the monopoly even more. Nevertheless, mercantilism eventually fell out of favour in exchange for Adam Smith’s free market – the American Revolution played a significant role in this. The way to destroy the established West Indian monopoly, was to destroy the slave trade and eventually slavery. Though the humanitarian voices were important for the slave emancipation, slavery was not abolished purely for humanitarian reasons: turning towards capitalism was the main motive. As illustrated by the continuation of buying cheap, slave grown products from Cuba, Brazil and the United States. Nevertheless, slavery was doomed, and the slave revolts across the West Indies were the last nail in the coffin. In sum, the industries created and money earned because of slavery, created the capital needed for the industrial revolution shortly thereafter.In history class the abolishment of slavery was described as a humanitarian endeavour, with great significance placed on the works of William Wilberforce. The following class would focus on the industrial revolution in England, and its subsequent economic power. Although never explicitly mentioned, I suspected that there was a bigger connection between slavery and the rise of Britain as a capitalist powerhouse than they told us. This book confirmed all my suspicions. This is an absolute must read to fully understand the economic consequences of, and reasons for/against slavery. For that alone this book deserves the full 5 stars. Although written almost a century ago, the language is easily accessible. Even with my scant knowledge of economic systems (and with the help of Wikipedia) I was able to comfortably understand the rough brushstrokes of the history. The finer details went over my head, but I bet they are satisfying to those with a better economic/history background. The middle part of the study was rather dense, but short enough not to be bothersome. I understand and value Williams argument that racism was secondary to the economic incentive regarding the slave trade, but I would have liked some more insight into how racism came to be how we know it today. Though that would probably be another study on its own.
After a disastrous civil war, the United States has fallen apart to form Panem: 12 districts (+ the destroyed 13th) controlled by the Capitol. To remind the subjected districts of the who is truly in power, every year one boy and one girl of each district will have to compete to the death in a game show, called The Hunger Games. Only one of the 24 children is allowed to survive and go back home. In the 74th Hunger Games, 16 year old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to safe her little sister Primrose. During the games Katniss has to rely on her hunting skills and instincts to survive. On top of that, she is now a pawn in a political game bigger than she could have ever imagined. In all honesty, The Hunger Games is a magnificent work of art, that is still as relevant in 2009 as it is now. I first read this when I was in high school, back then I understood that the topic was tragic but I mainly connected to the romance aspect of the story (#teamPeeta). I loved Katniss because she was cool and a fighter. Now, as an adult, I finally grasp the full implications of Panem’s politics, the position of the districts and how it plays out during the Games. Everything about Katniss’ character emotionally broke me: from her having to feed her family to her having to deal with so much unnecessary violence. I still love Katniss, but now almost as a mom who wants to protect her childhood innocence. The most heart-breaking realization I had while reading, is that somehow I can understand how a society can behave like this. For a dystopian book, nothing is that far removed from current reality. I recognize the cognitive dissonance ascribed to the citizens of the Capitol – e.g. how the real life war in Ukraine has been memeified on certain platforms. Everything about this novel (trilogy) is brilliant. Nah, in all seriousness: no book written for teenagers should have such a hold on me. From the moment Katniss volunteered for Prim, I was crying. (view spoiler)[ Which turned into full on sobbing when Rue dies. (hide spoiler)] I had a massive headache afterwards. Suzanne Collins I will sue for emotional damage, but also you are an absolute genius. The world building was amazing, the diversity is impressive, the characterization is wonderful. No character is flat, every person has something that explains the way they are: the death of Katniss father and the relationship with her mom; Peeta’s need to be seen as an individual; Haymitch’s alcoholism to numb the pain. I feel for all of them. And I’m going to cry for all of them during “Catching Fire”. I’m ready for another headache.
This book came highly recommended to me, I had such high expectations, but they were not met at all. There were too many discrepancies for me to enjoy this story. The topic is important and worthwhile, but the execution was severely lacking. The biggest question I still have is, how does the time traveling work??? This bothered me throughout reading this book
“Later these events would be turned into stories of absurd and nonchalant heroics, a sideshow to the great tragedies in Europe, but for those who lived through it, this was a time when their land was soaked in blood and littered with corpses.”This Nobel Prize winning novel gives a snapshot of East-Africa during the late colonial period and right after the disbanding of the colonies – rather than focusing on the colonial powers, it gives an account of the lives lived in that time period. The story primarily focuses on Hamza and Afiya. Starting off, Afiya is a little girl being whose parents died, and whose brother was stolen by German colonial troops. By a stroke of luck, Afiya is able to live with her brother’s friend after he joins the colonial army. In parallel, Hamza flees a life of bondage to also join the colonial army: here he is taken under the wing of an German officer. While he is safe from the brunt of the war, he is ridiculed for his close relationship to the officer. Afiya and Hamza find each other and do their everything they can to create a life together they both thought impossible in their darkest days.This was a very impressive novel, but not a novel you read for ‘fun’. The topics are rather heavy. And though the story is set in the first half of the 20th century, and in a area I’m only slightly familiar with: the people and their dynamics are written in such a way that speaks to the innate human experience – it is human to fight for a better future than where you come from. What this book does most brilliantly is shed an important perspective to colonialism. More often than not, the colonial history is told from a white/European perspective; this book gives the clear unfiltered African/local perspective. While colonialism is definitely a main topic, it does not overshadow what the story is actually about, the people. It was a humbling experience to read about the casual cruelty of the German, British and even Italian colonialists in a world that my own family comes from. It makes me feel closer to my own heritage. Though, at times, it was uncomfortable to read because it confronted me with the generalizing view I have of the colonial history. It is too easy to forget the individual lives affected while discussing big topics like colonialism. This book is a well written smack in the face for everyone who tends to forgot this too. I highly recommend.
The Bennet family are a slightly impoverished gentle family in the English countryside. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have 5 not yet wedded daughters: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Lydia and Kitty. This causes a significant amount of stress to Mrs. Bennet, without husbands they will be destitute. So when the nearby manor is let to a rich bachelor, she is determined to have him marry one of her daughters. When meeting this bachelor, Mr. Bingley, who so happens to immediately fall in love with Jane, they also meet the mysterious and brooding Mr. Darcy. Though the initial meeting between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy was far from cordial, they are stuck in a turbulent relationship in which they must overcome the sins of pride and prejudice. This book has my whole entire heart, I loved every second reading this. From the iconic first line to the perfectly happy ending, I ate it up. Elizabeth Bennet is one of my all-time favourite heroines - no wonder my child is partially named after her, she’s everything to me. Her character gives the perfect insight into an unfair world that solely values women for their ability to marry well, birth heirs and behave delicately. I especially enjoyed the contrast created between Caroline, the perfect embodiment of society’s view of femininity and Elizabeth, a woman who stands for her own values and choices. Which was again challenged by Charlotte’s pragmatic (and understandable knowing the society) approach to romance. Additionally, the comedy of characters such as Mrs. Bennet, she truly is ridiculous, is brilliantly undercut with the message that she has no choice to be this way because her value is dependent on the marriages of her daughters. She will literally lose it all unless they marry. Now on to the men, I love Mr. Darcy, but he too is a victim to society, as most evidently shown by his aunt’s interference. It is beautiful to see his growth, especially since it’s entirely motivated by the love and respect he has for Elizabeth. Unfortunately, the iconic hand scene is not canon, but I could easily imagine it. The one thing of the book I will never accept is Mr. Collins height, he is not tall he is a short awkward man like he is in the 2005 movie. This my favourite Jane Austen novel, by far!
With every book that I read (from any genre), the more sure I am that historical fiction is by far my favorite genre - so this book is everything I love and more. This novel chronicles the reign of French King Philip the fair, in the early years of the fourteenth century. This book starts in the seventh, and last year of the prosecution against the Knights Templar. The order is near eradicated, and with a last surge of power the last Grand Master curses the King, and his descendants to the thirteenth generation. Soon enough it appears that the curse has worked, King Philip and his family are quickly involved in the biggest scandals in the realm.With a historical fiction that jumps in the middle of a complicated history, the first chapter makes or breaks the book for me. If the first chapter takes considerable effort to get through, I know I won’t be able to enjoy the rest of the book no matter how good the story. I was hooked from the very first paragraph. Druon describes the scenes in a way that is familiar enough to understand, and also otherworldly (othertimely ?) enough to transport you to a completely new world. The characters are complex and compelling, even the least written about characters have depth to them. Though it did take me some time to get comfortable with all the characters and the relations between each other. I can’t rate this book with 5 stars, because I don’t think this book is entirely accessible without some prior knowledge of the time period. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel: I found myself screaming at what happened multiple times. The book reads exceptionally fast, at every turn of the page I couldn’t wait to find out how the story continues. No story line felt forced, and all the lines were beautifully drawn together, effortlessly switching from one character to the next. Every step taken seemed entirely logical for the characters, which made the story all the more believable. I’m very excited to read the next novel in this series!
Set in Paris, late 1800’s, women are completely under the mercy of their male relatives. One wrong word, one wrong action or even the wrong existence, and men can choose to send them away to the Salpetrière Asylum – under the guise of insanity. The head of the hospital, Dr. Charcot regularly places women under hypnotism in lieu of treating their actual mental health issues. These ‘mad’ women are, in an exhibitionist way, allowed to mingle with regular society once a year, during the Mad Women’s Ball. For the recently admitted Eugénie, the ball is her only opportunity to escape with the help of the strict nurse Geneviève. Essentially, this book tries to give insight into the realities of a patriarchal society in which mental health is not understood, and women even less. Before starting, I had such high hopes for this book. This topic is right up my alley: historical fiction focused on women wrapped in a gothic layer? I love it. This book might also be the prettiest in my bookcase. Sad to say, this book did not live up to those expectations. Though it’s clear that Mas did a lot of research for this book. The points she makes about the patriarchal society, the way people thought about mental health and women’s roles therein are very compelling. I loved remarks such as: “One might almost think that, in imposing such [physical and mental] restrictions, men did not so much scorn women as fear them.” But, the story and character progression was clunky at times. I got major whiplash reading when sturdy, analytical Geneviève went from 0 to 100 in believing Eugénie. Additionally, it was disappointing when the same plot twist was used twice: the close family member betraying the trust of someone they were supposed to love. It portrays unimaginative plot writing. In my opinion, the supernatural plot was entirely unnecessary, especially unexplained as it was. I think Mas would be better suited in writing an nonfiction book about this topic, she is clearly very knowledgeable about this topic.I think I was most disappointed with the messages infused in the novel. I completely agree with the main point about how the patriarchy dismissed and abused women and their (mental) health. The side and concluding points were not as good. E.g. the point that religion is bad kept on popping up. Sure organized religion has (and still does) played a big role in suppressing the rights of women, but individual faith in God is not inherently negative. Lastly, the conclusion was downright bad. Throughout the novel Mas juxtaposed the idea that women were forced into asylums against the idea that a women centred asylum is safe compared to the male dominated outside. So far so good. But I can’t agree with the point Genevieve appeared to make: that she her entirely life was misunderstood, but locked in the asylum she finally found her place. This bordered to close to “yes the women might be locked up, but they should be grateful because here they are safe and understood”. First off, this is a way too positive take on 19th century asylums, and it subverts the entire point that their freedom is taken away. Yeah, no thanks. I wish this book gave me what I wanted it to give.
I bought this book wanting to broaden my scope by reading contemporary, black American writers. This book came highly acclaimed, so I thought: “why not?” And now I know “why not”, I didn’t understand a single thing of what was going on in this book. I think as a (black) Dutch reader I understand too little about African-American culture to appreciate Beatty’s satire. To me it read like a long, confusing monologue about how racism still plays a big part in our “post-racial” world. But please, do not ask me anything about the details of this book, I did not understand a single thing.
Daphne and Simon both have their own reasons for disliking being out among London’s society. Daphne because she is getting on in an age, yet she has had no proper suitor. Simon because avoiding marriage is exceedingly difficult as an eligible bachelor. To enhance Daphne’s chances on the marriage market, and to allow Simon to opt out, they decide to enter a false engagement of sorts. All seems to be working well, until the romantic feelings are no longer faked and one potential scandal forces them closer together than ever. Last year, I watched the Bridgerton Netflix show, and I thought it was pretty alright. Since I often prefer the book over its tv-adaptation, I thought I’d give the book a shot. I’ve come to find out that this is not the book for me, and honestly I should have known better, I’ve never liked romance books. Though, I do love a good period drama, so it was a 50/50 toss up for me liking this – I did not like this. The ‘history’ of this book was almost immediately ruined for me. Usually, I don’t mind an occasional anachronistic add-on, but Quinn’s complete disregard of 19th century language and proper conduct was too much. The conversations were awful to read. And they way all characters constantly threaten to kill each other when it isn’t even that deep, massive turn off. If I had to settle for one anachronism, I’d rather have Quinn take out the blatant misogyny and the over usage of the word ‘female’, especially in the sentences/conversations where ‘males’ are called men. Additionally, for a romance book I found the central relationship entirely lacking in romance. Simon’s thoughts about Daphne upon first meeting her was immediately creepy – why did he admit to wanting to grope her, with or without her consent??? And then only backing off because she is a Bridgerton does not excuse any previous thoughts. Like, sir? Hello?? That would have been sexual assault. Their engagement was also far from romantic, it was extremely emotionally manipulative. And then the manipulation kept going, with the whole can’t/won’t have children debate. Somehow it got even worse during that scene, the infamous rape scene. Excuse me??? That was disgusting. To top it all off, the story somehow makes Daphne out to be justified in her actions, absolutely fucking not. But I know myself, I will probably read the other 7 books too :(
After Athena’s death in a freak accident, her sometimes literary rival, sometimes friend June steals her latest, unseen manuscript. It is all too easy to polish up the manuscript, remove the too clear references to Athena’s Asian heritage and publish it under an ethnically ambiguous name (Juniper Song) and rake in the success that should have been Athena’s. But soon enough, the lies become too big for June to contain. And she discovers how far she is willing to go to protect what she thinks she deserves. Obviously, what happens next is entirely everyone else’s fault, and not June’s.Firstly, I love R.F. Kuang’s writing. This is the fifth book of hers I’ve read, and all of them have been a breeze to read. Every time she immediately grabs my attention, and does not let go until the very last sentence. The way June’s internal reasoning is written is like watching a disgusting yet fascinating zit being popped. I detest June with all my heart and soul. Obviously, the point of the novel is to hate her, but the acceleration of her villainy near the end of the novel was a little too much, in my opinion. I’m sure every POC has met a person like June – someone who claims to be progressive, but who is secretly only claiming to be so because it elevates their social status. In reality they are just as bigoted and harmful (maybe even more so) than the outright racists. I have experienced this, so maybe that’s why the message of the novel was a little too much on the nose for me. From the beginning on, I predicted how June would handle the situation she created. I don’t think the messaging of this book was meant for me, because I already get it. Though the twist of Diana pushing June down the stairs instead of the other way around, like I predicted would happen? Gooped and gaggedThough this is my least favourite Kuang book, I still screamed and gasped while reading this. I loved getting an insight into the world of publishing. I know it is a ruthless world, but like this? Goddamn. I could feel Kuang giving us a glimpse into her personal reality. Crazily enough, while reading this the Cait Corrain review bombing controversy happened – is it art imitating life, or life imitating art?
“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more” *Screaming, crying and throwing up - when is it my turn??!!??*In a picturesque little town in the English countryside lives Emma: a rich, beautiful, witty and awfully self-assured young woman. She has vowed to never get married, but that doesn’t stop her from arranging advantageous marriages for all those around her. Riding on the succes of the latest happy marriage she meddled in, Emma is convinced that she can do the same for her newest friend Harriet. Though against her expectations, matchmaking turns out to be a destructive hobby for a bored lady in a sleepy town. This classic novel is one of Jane Austen’s most popular comedies, and trust, this book made me giggle on multiple occasions.I first read this book years ago, on a summer holiday to Italy and I completely fell in love with it: this book created my preference for classic novels about women written by women. Emma is the blueprint. I was so excited to revisit it, and I had such high expectations. I’m sad to say I struggled getting through it this time around. At times I was almost bored. I love the overall structure and comedy, and I adore how Emma learns and grows throughout the book. I had forgotten how awful Emma is at the beginning of the book, but at the end she seems so much more balanced and less stuck up - she is amazingly written and I will always love her. Though, the character progression was a little too slow for my liking. Additionally, characters who are written to be insufferable, were near the end of the novel almost too insufferable to continue reading (looking at you Mrs. Elton and Miss Bates). They lost their comedic value once their tropes were too overplayed. Honestly, I kind of regret rereading this book - by doing so it’s lost it’s original magic. Things I missed as a teenager, I cannot ignore as an adult. I know this book was written in a completely different time period, but I did puke a little when Mr. Knightley confessed to loving Emma ever since she was THIRTEEN years old. Their age difference is one thing, but this truly took it too far for me. Nevertheless, Jane Austen is still one of my favorite authors of all time, the way she can transport me: exceptional. For now, I’m going to stick to the excellent 2020 movie adaptation, and hope to get back the magic I felt when I was 15.
Throughout reading this novel, I kept saying to myself: ‘This book is like Game of Thrones, but without the magic’, which basically makes it well written, intriguing English history. This novel captures the years leading up to that fateful year of 1066. Throughout his reign, it becomes clear that King Edward is an indecisive, incapable ruler. Essentially, he is thrown around between the power hungry people of his court. While Edward’s hold on power diminishes, the sons of the Godwin family are in the midst of the race towards the crown. This race includes betrayal, shifting alliances and even murder within the family. After the death of Edward, Harold Godwinson becomes the next king, the last Anglo-Saxon king to be crowned. Merely a few weeks after his rise to the throne, the Duke of Normandy comes in to change the future of England forever. I tried to read this novel a few years ago. Back then I couldn’t get past the first chapter, so I was hesitant picking this up again. Now I can truly say that Helen Hollick is an exceptional writer. This time, I was hooked before the end of the first chapter. It is historical fiction that got me hooked onto reading when I was a child, reading this made me fall in love with the magic of history and story-telling all over again. The characters were intricate, complicated and flawed like real people. The progression of the story, while slow, felt exciting. After the end of every chapter, I wanted to know what would happen next. Even when you know the broad strokes of English history, the story feels fresh. There were moments I truly gasped. I wholeheartedly would recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in Anglo-Saxon/English history. “Heroes belong in the tale-teller’s world, they do not exist in reality. They are made of naught but sand and moon-dust”
This classic novel was a delight to read, I finished it in two hours – I couldn’t put it down. The story follows the well-established lawyer Mr. Utterson, who learns about the sinister figure Mr. Hyde through his relative Mr. Enfield. It so happens that Utterson’s good friend Dr. Jekyll has written a will that bestows Mr. Hyde with all of his property if he disappears. Mr. Utterson is puzzled by the seemingly close relationship between the well-respected Dr. Jekyll and the ruffian Mr. Hyde. Utterson wants to get to the bottom of it, and stumbles across mysterious occurrences that involve Dr. Jekyll, their mutual friend Dr. Lanyon and, of course, Mr. Hyde. Eventually, Mr. Utterson receives a letter from Dr. Jekyll, detailing everything that has happened in the months since Mr. Utterson first learned about Mr. Hyde. It turns out, nothing was what it seemed.When reading well known classics like this, I usually already know the rough idea of the novel. Sometimes that destroys the magic of the story, but here I absolutely did not mind already knowing the truth of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The suspense still grabbed me by the throat; the slow paced scenes were just as exciting as the faster paced ones. Additionally, I’m obsessed with the beautiful, lyrical language used. Though, I did have to get used to the sentence structure at the beginning. On top of that, this book was surprisingly funny at times. I audibly laughed at the: “Mr Hyde, Mr. Seek” joke. At the same time, Stevenson offers some interesting insights into the duality of man, and how people ought not to deal with their ‘evil’ side. This was an amazing read, short and sweet and straight to the point with lovely philosophical takes in between. The only big thing that I did not like about the novel, is the good = beautiful; bad = ugly trope. I get the idea that Mr. Hyde is less developed and therefore smaller and deformed, but just saying that someone is evil because they’re ugly always feels so mean. Lastly, I did not entirely get why Mr. Hyde would have the motivation to voluntarily turn back to Mr. Jekyll. Turning back would be a good deed, unless he would only turn back to save his own skin from persecution. Overall, I loved it, definitely a 4/5 stars book.
** spoiler alert ** This slightly less awful sequel to an awful book, picks up the story after the defeat of Amarantha. Everything seems to be looking up for Feyre, she’s back safe at the Spring Court and engaged to Tamlin. But Feyre is still dealing with the repurcussions of her fight against Amarantha, and Tamlin turns out to be an overly protective asshole. Just before tying the knot, Rhysand swoops in and takes Feyre away. At the Night Court, and with the help of Rhys and his chosen family, Feyre slowly comes to turn with her new identity. On top of that, Feyre and Rhys start to form an powerful relationship. Even with Amarantha gone, the danger has not subsided. The King of Hybern is supposedly looking for a weapon to finish what Amarantha started. With her new found power, Feyre is again thrown in the middle of the fight for the survival of Faeries and humans alike. I hated this book too, only slightly less than I hated ACOTAR – all because Maas is an tragically bad writer. Firstly, I hate how the relationship between Rhys and Feyre is established. In order for us to like Rhys, Tamlin has to become the most villainous villain? If such a negative contrast is needed, for the ‘good guy’ to be seen as good, maybe he isn’t all that great. It is also ridiculous that Tamlin is crucified for his apparent possessiveness, but it is okay when Rhys threatens everybody who even looks funny at his ‘Mate’… Maas, please stop. On top of that, why does Rhys have to be the absolute best at everything? He’s the most handsome, the most powerful and, of course, most rich – this makes Rhys a boring character. Secondly, I honestly do not are about the other characters at the Night Court. Yes, the banter was occasionally a fun distraction from the awful plot, but their characterization is so flat. Jurrian was an unexpected twist though. Thirdly, the writing is again is infuriatingly repetitive. Every other word is either: “mate”; “purred”; or “drawled” – it’s so annoying. Additionally, it seems as if Maas thinks her readers are stupid, we can get the point the first time it is mentioned. Maas really did not have to keep on comparing Rhys to Tamlin like that. Lastly, the world building is so inconsistent. Women wear gowns like it’s the Victiorian Era, but there is modern plumbing? I cringed every time somebody flushed a toilet, or turned a faucet. And don’t get me fucking started on the ending. Again, I do not care about the characters enough to be upset by the turning of Elain and Nesta. I did however get extremely upset when Maas basically used the same plot again, when Lucian was revealed to be Elain;s mate… Absolutely ridiculous, I hate it here, again. On a good note, though, the spice was relatively okay. At first I was startled by the mentions of the ‘nasty’ in a book that reads like a teen novel – but it could have been so much worse seeing Maas’ writing track record.
The British Empire in the 19th century is at its height of colonialism, and with the help of linguistically enhanced silver bars their grip on the world shows no sign of easing. Robin, born in Canton, China, is brought to England by a strict and mysterious sponsor. In England he is given the best education possible, so that he can join Babel, the prestigious Royal Institute of Translation. Because of his background in Mandarin and Cantonese, Robin quickly discovers that he is invaluable to the Empire. But he also discovers that his value is used in ways that conflict with his identity as an colonial immigrant. What appeared as a dream come true, reveals itself to be a nightmare turned reality.It took me a while to pick up this book from my shelf, I was scared to be let down after all the hype it got. My fear was entirely ungrounded, this book is amazing! I loved every letter, page and chapter of it. I don’t think I have ever read a book so anti-colonialist, it was refreshing. and the obvious research that went into it is so impressive and inspiring. The fantasy element of the silver bars works so incredibly well, it perfectly encapsulates the overreaching effects of colonialism on the global scale – it focuses the problem on one object that can be explored extensively. Without it, I don’t think the point Kuang makes would have come across as clearly. This book is incredibly well thought out, and beautifully executed. It reads fast, it’s fascinating from start to finish, the characters are rounded and complex. I loved it. Midway there was one point where I was starting to get slightly bored with the constant foreshadowing whenever Robin and friends were happy. But the moment I registered that feeling, the pace of the novel picked up tremendously. I could not have guessed anything about the latter half of the book. I was screaming, crying and tearing my hair out. The ending was beautifully bittersweet: Victoire talking about victory hit me straight in my soul. I was most impressed by how all major characters clearly represent different views of point on colonialism. The boys are two sides of the same coin: Robin as the “privileged” outsider who slowly realizes what the privilege costs, and Ramy as the outsider who knows how to harness their status as outsider. The dynamic between the two girls Letty and Victoire also added a lot of dimension. Yes, Letty is an outsider because she is a woman, but that does not mean that she understands the outsideness of Victoire who is both a woman and black. Letty’s character arc shook me to my core, and I dislike her with a passion. Victoire is, of course, my favourite. The ending was ambiguous, so I’m praying this means we will get a sequel.
The French countryside, mid-19th century is a boring place to be for a beautiful young girl who longs for adventure, passion and a love of the ages. After leaving a convent, Emma anticipates her marriage to Charles Bovary. Who, to her dismay, turns out to be a dull, unambitious and slightly stupid small town doctor. In an attempt to still her boredom and fulfil her own romantic ambitions, Emma engages in her delusions. She enters an extramarital affair with a local landowner, she indulges her whims and creates massive debt. And though she’s in a whirlwind of her own making, her story is nothing but the tragic tale of a girl who can’t escape her lot in life because she was born a small town woman.Another fantastic reread, I absolutely adore this book – Emma is iconic. She is so relatable in her delusions and in her hunger for more. Her character is beautifully tragic and stupid, I can’t help but have a soft spot for her. Though her story might be exaggerated, Flaubert clearly illustrates the unfairness of the position of women in a society that does not take their feelings/thoughts/concerns seriously. Emma had no choice but to escalate her behaviour, if she wanted to find a modicum of happiness and control. Of course her fixation is then placed on men, because they are and have everything she wants – to her it is infinitely unfair that her husband who can do everything opts to be unambitious while she who wants the world can go nowhere. This is most clearly illustrated by her thoughts about Berthe, she’s disappointed in her daughter for being a girl, just as she is disappointed in herself, now not even her offspring can have the freedom she longs for. The tragedy, I love it and Gustave Flaubert is an unexpected but amazing feminist.For a classic novel, this book is pretty easy to read. The sentence structure just needs a little getting used to. The characters are great, though only Emma is fully explored. The towns people add a perfect ridiculousness to truly bring home Emma’s despair in her social situation. Though the ending is slightly boring, I did not care anymore after her death since she was the only character I truly connected with.
After the 74th Hunger Games Katniss tries to adjust to normal life again. This proves virtually impossible when President Snow makes clear that he holds her responsible for the whispers of rebellion spreading throughout the Districts. Katniss has no choice but to do whatever the Capitol wants of her to ensure the survival of her family and friends. That too is not as straightforward as Katniss thinks. The third Quarter Quell is coming, anti-Capitol thought is growing and the fear of death is constantly looming. The stakes are higher than imaginable, and with all eyes on her Katniss has to watch every move she makes. It was great to revisit this banger of a book years later. Again, as a teen I was way more invested in the love triangle, now I could not care less. I even really dislike Gale. I found his pride, his refusal to ask for help and his inability to see what Katniss was going through absolutely insufferable. He is not it. Though, I do think that readers should give Katniss more grace when considering the choices she makes in her love triangle, and all her choices in general. In books where teens are thrust into insurmountable responsibility, readers tend to forget that they are still teens and start to resent those children for displaying age appropriate behaviour – Katniss is not grown just because she’s had to fight for her survival. And with all the trauma she has already experienced, of course she is not going to make all rational choices all the time. I think that the tragedy is only made greater because she is still so young, and already damaged. But for a girl so young, she does think about marriage a little too much. This book is a perfect sequel. Suzanne brilliantly expands on the stakes raised in the first book. In clear and simple language, she perfectly conveys what Katniss caused and how the consequences unfold for individuals as well as the entire society. Whereas first my anxieties were limited to the characters of District 12, now I’m worried for literally everybody. Now that the scope of the novel has zoomed out compared to the first novel, I do find myself less emotionally attached to individual characters – I cried way less. Additionally, the pacing threw me for a loop a few times: read a little too fast and you will have completely missed how Peeta volunteered to take Haymitch’ place in the Games. These little faults are entirely forgiven because Suzanne blessed us with an absolute banger of a cliff-hanger. I knew it was coming, but still it had me screaming with a racing heart. Obviously, I cant wait to read the last book, Suzanne Collins you have me by the throat.
This unsettling debut novel tells the story of Vanessa Wye. At 15, while attending a boarding school, Vanessa catches the eye of her way older English teacher, Jacob Strane. Isolated from her parents, and without friends to confide in, Vanessa revels in the attention she gets from Strane. To her, he is the only one who sees her as special when she feels ordinary at best. Quickly enough, the attention Vanessa gets exceeds the attention a teacher should give a student. And she’s stuck in this whirlwind, volatile and ruinous affair with Strane. During it all, the question that never leaves her mind: is this love, or is this abuse? Her story is told in two fold. One part of the story tells her experiences as a teen and young adult, in the midst of the affair. The other part focuses on how the me-too movement triggers grown-up Vanessa to alter her perception of what happened. Both parts together tackle the difficult topics of grooming, power dynamics, and the aftermath of abuse. It took me a while to write this review, I couldn’t figure out how to write down my thoughts. This book covers such an important topic that needs to be discussed (and the book does so in a delicate way), it felt wrong to discuss trivial points like character development, and pacing. In all honesty, this was a difficult and painful book to read, too often I found myself identifying with Vanessa a little too much for comfort. Simultaneously, this is also what makes the book so brilliant. Vanessa is nobody special, she is a typical teenager trying to find her place in this world, she could have been any of us – and she got taken advantage of in the highest degree. This entire book felt suffocating, from the detailed and bleak descriptions of the world to the struggles Vanessa only displays to her deepest, darkest self. Reading this felt like watching a bee continuously bumping its head against the window, it wants to be free but it can’t. As long as the bee is stuck, you can’t breath either so you’re praying that it will find its way outside. The release I felt at the end of the novel, when Vanessa admits to what happened, I ever never felt that way after reading a book before.Early on in the novel I noticed clear Lolita-esque vibes, I wasn’t surprised when Vanessa read Lolita on Strane’s request. Lately, too often do people take Lolita as a romantic story about an unconventional love, which is absolutely disgusting. This book almost serves as an mirror image of Lolita, Vanessa’s story is what Lolita would be from Dolores’ perspective. Similarly, this book offers an insightful take on the #MeToo movement, and how such media attention can help certain victims while it simultaneously accentuate the pain of others. The most important take away I got from this book, is how the human mind can jump through incredible hoops to protect itself from indescribable pain. To me it is only logical that Vanessa has this overwhelming need to believe that Strane loved her, and she loved him – not believing would mean accepting that she has wasted years of her life on someone who only used her for his disgusting sexual needs. For this reason alone, this book is a important must read, and I have to rate it 5 stars.
Celie and Nettie grow up in the Deep American South, at a time where segregation was the norm. Before even becoming an adult, Celie has experienced tragedies that nobody should face. The two children she gets by the man she calls “father” are taken from her. After she is trapped in a marriage in which her husband sees hitting her as the most normal thing. Most tragically, Celie has lost the only person she ever loved: her sister Nettie. Eventually, she meets Shug, a singer who lives her life unapologetically. Through her, Celie discovers her power as a black woman, shaken free from the past with a bright future ahead.This is one of those classic books that I have been wanting to read forever, but somehow never pick up. It was time. It’s a lovely book about the difficulties of being a black woman in a time where that was seen as inherently bad. Overall, I really enjoyed reading this. I went through it so fast, the characters are all interesting (I love Sofia). And though they go through awful things, the humanity shines through every page. But, I’m sad to say, it doesn’t have a lasting effect on me. Partially because I did not like the ending. To me, the ending was too sugary sweet compared to the bitter, heart-breaking rest of the novel. I do appreciate character development, but Mr. turn around was too drastic for my liking. It is good he learned, but I highly doubt that someone as cruel as him would ever admit fault. Celie entirely forgiving him, and even going back to live with him kind of destroyed the progress she made into becoming an independent woman. And don’t get me started on Adam and Tashi, I did not like it. I had hoped for a more hopeful, yet bittersweet ending. Midway through, when Nettie’s letters became the centre of attention, I did border on getting bored. I appreciated the insight into black missionaries in Africa. The identity crisis that must have come with visiting Africa as an African American was fascinating but I kind of wished there was more of it, to go more in depth. Or, if depth is not possible, to strike it out completely. I felt that the sympathy garnered through Celie’s letters comes undone through Nettie’s perspective of Africa. Both storylines could have used more depth and nuance.
Once in a while you read a book that changes your perspective on life, and it was this book for me. It’s been a while since I’ve actually cried over a book. This book felt so real to me, it was almost like reading a diary. Because it felt so real, the horrifying things Precious has gone through shook me to my core.
Hemingway’s last great novel depicts a simple story. The fisherman Santiago has fallen on hard times, for the past 84 days he has been unable to catch fish. Nevertheless, he does not lose hope and truly believes that the 85th day is the day that he will catch his biggest fish. On his boat, Santiago contemplates his relation to the fish, through doing so he also ponders his life and how he is no longer what he used to be as a young man. After a life and death fight lasting for several days, Santiago manages to catch the fish and attach him to his boat. Yet, this is not the end of Santiago and the fish’s journey. It is entirely understandable that a novel such as this one had a big impact on the world of literature at the time. This book is beautifully written, with many great philosophical reflections. But to be entirely honest, the emotional parts that are supposed to move you, did not do it for me. I can see what Hemingway attempted to make me feel, and I can appreciate the stylistic choices made, but that is all. Beside that, I do think that this is an easy novel to read and it truly does have amazing pieces of prose. It makes me curious for other works of Hemingway.
Set in rural Mississippi, Larry lives on a farm with his mother and father in an atmosphere of constant repressed disappointment. On their property, in a rundown shack live Silas and his mother. Though they are worlds apart, Larry being middle class and white, Silas being black and poor, the two boys enter an unlikely friendship. When a teenage girl disappears, their lives are forever shaken up. Larry becomes to town pariah, suspected of having killed the girl. Silas moves town to attend a different school. Years later, another girl disappears, Silas who is now the town’s Constable has to come into contact again with Larry after years of no contact. As the mystery unravels, Larry and Silas need to come to term with their childhoods, their choices and their current relationship. For the life of me, I can’t remember when or where I bought this book, but I’m glad I have it. This was a surprisingly good read! The first aprt of the book starts incredibly slow (and boring), I seriously considered quitting. Having better grasp of the writing style, I’m sure that I would appreciate the atmospheric slow start more, if I were to reread this book. After the first big plot reveal about Silas, the pace of the book rapidly picked up – I could not put it down after that. I could not have predicted the twists and turns even if I tried to. Even more interesting than the twists themselves, is how the characters responded to them creating an intricate story about human relationships despite and because of things that happen in live. Stories about the difficult race relationships in the USA can be really uncomfortable to read, and while the story has uncomfortable moments, Franklin handled this in a respectful manner. All characters felt fully realized, so the usage of slurs (though shocking) felt in line with how the characters are.Coming of reading tons of High Fantasy, this book definitely forced me to switch gears. It took me a second to get into it, but once I did I was fully impressed with the subtleties Franklin infused into the story. I’m especially impressed with how the relationship between Larry and Wallace was written: it was heart-breaking to realize that Larry struggled to see the bad in Wallace, because Wallace was the only one being ‘kind’ to Larry. I felt so bad for Larry. And honestly, I was not convinced about the strength of the friendship between Larry and Silas, which, later on, made complete sense after learning more about Silas’ experiences. Franklin wrote the relationships between the characters beautifully. This is the type of read that I find difficult to gather my thoughts about, I would have to read it again to fully grasp every detail. Safe to say, I really enjoyed reading this.
New York, in the era of Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles: young Tish is nineteen and pregnant. Her lover Fonny, the father of her child, is falsely accused of rape and in jail. Which for a black men, is a worse sentence then death. Flashbacks from their love affair are woven into the compelling struggle of two families trying to win justice for Fonny. ‘If Beale Street Could Talk’ not only affirms the gentle love between a black man and a black woman, but it also deals with the love between members of a family in the face of a society that cannot see them for who they truly are. For the longest time, I was too afraid to James Baldwin’s work, because I knew that his words would touch my very soul. Thank god I did read this book, because it is one of most beautiful, gentle and heartwarming love stories I have ever read. A ‘love story’ in the biggest sense of the word: it affirms the love between a young couple, between supportive family members but it also tackles the love one can have for oneself even in the face of a society that tries to tell you to hate yourself. I was on the verge of tears the entire time while reading this, and the ending had me full on sobbing. The part that hit me the hardest was the unwavering family support offered to both Tish and Fonny, I could not help but wish that every human being could have just 10% of that support. I love to read stories about black people that centre their gentleness. Though certain parts of society love to claim to be post-racial, racism is still pervasive – just as much now, as when Baldwin wrote this book 50 years ago. There is still this tendency to characterize black people as inherently more violent, more prone to be abusive, their love is almost never highlighted. This book goes right against that, because of that it was incredibly emotional throughout. Despite what smarter people than me might say about the ending, in my mind, everything ended up okay. More than okay. Fonny gets out of jail, with no criminal record. The baby is healthy and strong. Together, Tish and Fonny will get what they deserve – a loving family, money to provide and most importantly, each other. Now I just need to find the (emotional) strength to watch the movie, I have got to buy a ton of tissues first.
This comprehensive little book gives an overview of the most influential philosopher in the history of western philosophy. Starting with the grandfather of it all Socrates, all the way up to the contemporary Peter Singer, Warburton intelligently creates a red line that connects all philosophers together. It is easy to follow how all current philosophy has grown out of the gadfly-like questions of Socrates. The chapters are short, easy to read yet give a full overview of the most important points of every philosopher. Even the most difficult to read works, like Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, are explained in a way that even those with no prior knowledge can easily understand the point. For those who want to gain deeper understanding, Warburton also clearly indicates what ideas come from which works. Essentially, this book is an easy to read reference book that is a delight to read. I bought this book years ago for the university course “History of Philosophy”, I never ended up reading it. Now as a high school teacher, I sometimes feel that I can’t answer students questions as extensively as I would like. So I finally read this book to brush up on my knowledge of philosophy. Some chapters were familiar, other chapters covered philosophers previously unknown to me – but all chapters were equally interesting. What I found the most useful, is that Warburton gives modern examples in approachable language to century old texts: it clearly shows how philosophy is always relevant. Additionally, I loved how Warburton does not use a male default, he is just as likely to use ‘she’ as ‘he’ in his examples. Even though the canon of western philosophy is an old-boy’s club, he also included enough contemporary female philosophers to show that philosophy is for everybody. I have nothing bad to say about this, I will definitely refer back to it if I need a refresher.
This story follows the life of Rachel, an ethnic rather than religious Jew, living in LA. Her entire life is focused on restriction, mainly restricting her eating - a remnant from her childhood with a (too) body conscious mother. Rachel’s rigid regime does not leave her any space for personal fulfillment. That is until she meets Miriam, a religious Jewish woman who appears to be intent on introducing flavor back into Rachel’s life. The sexual, spiritual and calorie hunger Rachel has suppressed for years comes back with a vengeance to change her life forever. From the gorgeous book cover, I already had a hunch that this book was going to be fascinating. My gut feeling was so right, this book touched me emotionally in ways I could have never guessed. I’m nothing like Rachel, yet I see myself in the way she struggles with her childhood; tries to get a grip on the relationship with her mom; and interacts with the world as a young adult. Especially her need to feel unconditionally loved and protected, like a parent would love their child, is something that I can relate to. Additionally, the way her relationship with food and her body is fundamentally intertwined with her identity made me reflect on how I situate food in my own life. Honestly, I’m almost afraid to know what absolutely loving this book says about me. This book reminds me of Eileen by Ottessa Mosfegh: both books tap into a femininity that is so raw, dark and even ugly but so real. It shows a side of womanhood that is usually kept behind closed doors, but I think it is important to keep the conversation going so that women can feel normal being their most authentic selves. This 100% the reason why I love reading books written by women, about women, for women - their point of view is so important. I loved this book, I’m going to be thinking about it for weeks after.
The lives of Edwin St. John St. Andrew (1912), Mirella (2020), Olive (2203), and Gaspery (2401) could not have been further removed from each other, geographically and time-wise. Yet these people are connected in a way that confounds even the specialists at the Time Institute. Yet somehow they all saw glimpses of a world that cannot exist. Maybe even more importantly, they all share an innate sense of humanity: the want to be exceptional in their own way and leave their traces on the world, big or small. Their lives together not only solve a mystery, but also reveal life-affirming sentiments in the face of destruction.This was such an unexpected masterpiece! I tore through it, could not put it down. I was hooked from the first sentence. Normally, I’m not the biggest fan of sci-fi, anything ‘pew-pew’ related and I’m out. But a sci-fi that uses a future set in space to say something about our current humanity? Absolutely adore it! Though there are a few challenging concepts, the writing style is so accessible, Mandel easily guides the reader through them. This book reads like expanded poetry, the sentences flow like beautiful melodies, and the ordering of chapters feel like a symphony. And the message is so beautiful and sweet: though loss and pain plague us throughout life, it is worth it as long as there is connection. There is no ultimate reason, or goal, we have to love each other and our lives will be lived worthwhile. Additionally, I loved the conclusion of the mystery. Though it is a conclusion I’ve read before, because of the beautifully written characters it feels very fresh and haunting. I’m definitely going to check out other books written by Mandel.The one thing I did not enjoy about this book was the constant referencing to COVID-19. Nothing wrong with that topic per se, it’s just that personally I do not want to be reminded of how I felt during 2020/2021. I bet this part will be less painful to read in another 5 years. At the same time, I understand that this work cannot have been made without the disastrous pandemic. Still too soon though.
I absolutely loved reading this classic piece on Love. Especially Aristophanes, Agathon and Socrates’ speeches moved me. It sure made me think about Love in my own life and how I want to cultivate it. I very much recommend these speeches to anyone wanting to reflect on the relationships they hold in life, whether they be romantic, platonic or even academic relationships.
Moll is the feminist icon I never thought I needed. I love a good book with a healthy dose of social criticism, and this book hit the right spot. Although Moll has done bad things in her life, Defoe clearly describes how Moll was a product of her society. And within that society she is a strong woman, with a will to survive and I was there with her all the way. The ending of the book was a little too “perfect” for me after all the hardship before, but this book is a solid read! The language takes a little too get used to though
Surprisingly, I liked this book way more than the previous in the Bridgerton series. The beginning was very similar to ‘The Duke and I’, in other words, cringey and disappointingly bad. Again, why do all the characters have such a strong urge to kill anyone who just slightly looks at them wrong/funny. Very off-putting. Additionally, again, with all the anachronisms in this book (the language, conversations and let’s not forget ‘pink being a girl’s colour’), I’m saddened that the massive amounts of misogyny of the period made it into the final product. Yet the latter half of the book really changed my mind, I enjoyed it so much, I even got teary eyed when Anthony and Kate got their happy ending.But let’s not forget, Anthony was absolutely insufferable at the beginning of the book, his thoughts were infuriating to read. The way he spoke about what type of woman he wanted for future wife was disgusting, as if she would be nothing but an incubator with his heirs. Anthony calling Kate a ‘bloodthirsty wench’ was the final straw. But, in the end, I very much enjoyed Anthony’s character, and the love story between him and Kate. The chemistry between them was so much better compared to Daphne and Simon’s. On top of that, the trauma both of them experienced was written so vividly and true, I couldn’t help but feel for both of them. I was particularly impressed with how Quinn accurately described the lasting effects such a ‘small’ moment in childhood can have on a person. The way Anthony and Kate saw each other’s pain and helped the other get through it was absolutely heartwarming. Obviously this book (and others of its type) is never going to achieve literary fame, but it is very enjoyable for a little romance novel. I was impressed by how Quinn expertly manages to switch the point of view so seamlessly well fitted into the story. It made the book feel fast paced, but not overly so. It also allowed for me to immediately know all feelings/thoughts of all characters present when something happened. It sucked me right into the story. Hopefully, the subsequent books also up their game compared to the previous one, and I’m sure to be enthusiastic about book 8.
I’m not American, nor Evangelical nor even a Christian but I was fascinated by every single page of this book. As a teen I used to watch TLC’s 19 Kids and Counting, before I realised how exploitative that show was. From then on, I’ve been intrigued by these Christian groups that apparently willingly follow these extremely outdated rules on man- and womanhood. I figured that they came to these conclusions because of their specific interpretation of the Bible, but I never knew how these interpretations came to be. This book more than answered my questions. I really enjoyed how Barr mixed her personal story with the historical overview. Biblical womanhood is not only a historical concept, but also a very personal one. I can’t imagine having to live according to such impossible and strict rules, and then to get out of it, which means losing everything you’ve ever known – unimaginably difficult. I was most shook up by the revelation about the Pauline letters. To me, Paul’s letters have always seemed so contrary to the message that Jesus’ preached in the Gospels. I knew that the Bible ought to be read in its proper context, I did (do) not know enough about Roman society in the first century to properly do that, though. So, when Barr revealed that Paul’s letters should be read in a specific argument style, everything fell into place. I used to be a ‘fuck Paul’ type of person, I’m definitely no longer. As with every book about the Bible, I notice that I clearly do not have the biblical knowledge to understand the more intricate details discussed. I would love to read this again with a Bible next to me, so I can actually read the verses Barr mentions.
“The white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. Now he has won our brothers, and our clan can no longer act like one. He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.” The story of the colonization of West-Africa is a story I’m moderately familiar with. This is not the first book I’ve read on this topic. But this is the first book that built such a vivid picture of regular life before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, that I thoroughly felt the shock they must have brought along with their arrival. To be fair, Okonkwo is definitely not a likeable character in any way, shape or form, yet I “understood” his worldview, I could sympathize with him. This perfectly sells the point: white colonization is violent no matter on whom it is inflicted.
“At this period the real similarity between the two countries lay in the persons of their kings. Both in London and in Paris the crown had devolved on a weak man, incapable of that true concern for the public good without which a prince is but a prince in name.”The fifth book in the ‘Accursed Kings’ series picks up after the death of King Phillipe V. Now, the third brother has his moment on the throne: long live king Charles IV. While France has got to get settled under yet a new king, England has been under the rule of King Edward II and his French wife Isabella for quite some time. Edward proves to be a weak king: stuck under the wiles of his lover Hugh. Together with the rebel baron Roger Mortimer, Isabella absconds to her home country France. From across the channel, Mortimer tries to reclaim his lost lands and power, and have Edward relinquish his throne. The historical drama is never ending. I was so excited for this fifth instalment. I loved the fourth novel, I was hoping to continue on that high. Alas, this book was so boring in comparison. Somehow I could not connect with the characters like I did previously. Even characters I’ve loved throughout the series did not hit in the same way. Mauhaut was no longer a bad bitch, but a vindictive old woman. Guccio also really pissed me off, why did he steal the child away from Marie? That’s just wrong. The Pope however, he was doing it for me – Father, pop off. Additionally, for a book that is called ‘The She-Wolf’, I was disappointed in the lack of agency Isabella seemed to have. Obviously, women had less/different agency in the Middle Ages, but she was written as a love-sick puppy in need of attention, instead of a political figure with a voice in her own right. I did cheer when she finally told Mortimer off near the end of the novel. On top of that, the end of the novel did touch an emotional nerve, the decline of King Edward II was written in a beautifully tragic way, loved that. Beside my complaints, the obvious grasp of historical setting that Druon has, is still just as impressive. Throughout the book he makes interesting points about the political world of the 14th century – like how a monarchical society stops to function when they have a lacking monarch. Every time I pick up one of Druon’s novel, it takes a second to get used to his factual, yet fictional way of writing. It takes energy to read his work. But I’m willing to keep on putting in the work to finish this series, I’m really intrigued to see if there are even worse kings/queens to come in this Capet family line.
This traumatizing piece of literature follows the lives of four classmates in New York: Jude, Willem, Malcolm and JB. Though they come from different places, and long for different futures, they are bound together by a friendship that transcends everything. Through the years, through the ebb and flow of love, addiction, and success their relationship stays anchored by the charismatic, brilliant yet unknowable Jude. And though it is clear that Jude carries the heavy load of childhood trauma, even after decades he remains a mystery to them all. For months I was too scared to pick up this book, and for a good reason. I am traumatized, broken and numb - I can never ever read this again. But, for the most part, I ate this up. I loved the theme of friendship. The 4 guys were all clearly distinct from each other, and none of their relationships felt the same. Reading about them truly felt like getting to know them. This book was so refreshing with its exploration of gender, race and sexual orientation. And with getting to know Jude, Hanya beautifully explores how trauma has lasting effects in someone’s life. The way Jude’s history is revealed is done in such a brilliantly devastating way, every time I thought we had reached the bottom of the well another layer is revealed. The 4 main friends are amazingly round and complex characters, the side-characters not so much – Harold and Andy do not change/progress at all throughout the decades. Additionally, near the end of the novel I did reach my threshold of reading trauma. It was all way too much, I had become numb. It started to feel like that Hanya keeps on adding increasingly worse trauma just for the shock factor, not to respectfully and sincerely discuss its effects (view spoiler)[ – like, it felt unnecessary that Jude was so young when the sexual abuse happened. (hide spoiler)] In my opinion, certain traumas could have been cut to more deeply explore the others: (view spoiler)[Dr. Traylor felt too much of a repetition of Brother Luke. (hide spoiler)]It already took me so long to get through this because it was so painful, but the last 200 pages were almost boring because emotionally I could not take it anymore. This 800 page book should have been edited down to 600. For someone who does not believe in therapy (view spoiler)[(oof, did I hate the part where Willem realizes that therapy is violating) (hide spoiler)], Hanya Yanagihara did write a book that made me understand myself in a way I did not before. Certain triggers, or feelings and their explanations that the characters experienced I could apply to my own life. But my god, I will never put myself through reading something as brutally awful and detailed as this.
Under the rule of the Mongol Empire, the Zhu family has almost entirely starved to death. In a last ditch grasp for hope, the father takes his son to have his fortune told. He is given a fate of greatness. But when he dies, his fate is left up for grabs for the daughter. She will now be Zhu Shongba and make his fate her own. When Zhu’s temple sanctuary is destroyed, her path is open to grab the biggest greatness she can find.I had such high hopes for this book, and I am so disappointed. The main feeling I had while reading this was absolute and total boredom, it took so much effort to get through this book. First off, I could not connect to any of the characters. They were all awful to me. Zhu especially was really annoying, (view spoiler)[ and so obviously the real villain – the twist was not shocking to me at all. (hide spoiler)] And to be honest, she wasn’t even that good of a monk nor a general, but due to circumstances outside of her she got given so much power. And then shocker, she was not a good political mind at all. She hardly did anything to reach ‘the greatness’ she’s so desperately after. And don’t get me started on the overuse of the word ‘greatness’. It was especially grating because the context to what ‘greatness’ means in this book, was never fully explained! Infuriating. And for a book that is kind of about a woman’s strength to survive, women were described in a surprisingly negative way. Every woman was seen as obviously inferior, and useless, except for maybe Ma. But Ma was taken advantage of and bamboozled into the fate she tried so desperately to avoid. No woman got out okay. On the topic of women, Zhu’s insistence that she understands the woman’s position so well, despite never having been an adult woman really pissed me off. She hasn’t been a woman since she was like 10 years old! Honestly, the only character I kind of liked is Lord Wang, he did no wrong. I love a good fantasy book, magic systems, maybe some interference from the divine – I love it all. But I hate it when the magic system is not explained nor fully incorporated into the world. Whenever anything supernatural was mentioned, it felt so out of place. In my opinion, the magic/divine has to be given a proper context, and woven into the worldbuilding, not just offhandedly explained in the back half of the book. And I still don’t understand it, what was up with the ghosts, what do they mean? What is the actual role of heaven in this? What is the mandate and why can some people conjure up fire? EXPLAIN IT PLEASE. Instead of proper worldbuilding, we get several hints towards a character’s humiliation kink (view spoiler)[and a very explicit (and out of place) fisting scene… (hide spoiler)] Oh, okay. This was just not for me.
After walking through a portal in the Tower of the Swallow, thus narrowly escaping death Ciri finds herself in a completely different world... a world of the Elves. She is trapped with no way out. Time does not seem to exist and there are no obvious borders or portals to cross back into her home world. But this is Ciri, the child of prophecy, and she will not be defeated. She knows she must escape to finally rejoin Geralt, and his companions - and also to try to conquer her worst nightmare. Bonhart, the man who chased, wounded and tortured Ciri, is still on her trail. And the world is still at war.I hate to say it, but I did not like this ending for the saga. I am disappointed. I get what the ending is trying to convey: evil is not only found in monsters, but also/even more so in ordinary people. I’m too much of a romantic to connect to such a gloomy ending. I just wanted a happy ending in which Geralt and Yennefer are together, happy and alive. And Ciri to be finally fully free from other’s plans for her. That immediately brings me to another plot point I absolutely despised: the consistent sexualization of a little girl. Ciri is only 16 for god’s sake. The language used to describe her and her womb, disgusting! And her dad, wanting to marry her…? Major ick. Still, this book did tug on my heart strings. All the action scenes, from the war to the final showdown at Stygga Castle were so gripping. My heart was racing while reading. I cried with Iola, and for Jarre and I bawled when Milva and Angoulême died. I screamed when Ciri finally killed that creepy motherfucker Bonhart. I did not, and still do not care about Cahir though. I was very disappointed that Dandelion did not get his heroic moment. It was such a let down when he just stayed behind in Toussaint. It felt so out of character, Dandelion playing house? Never.It took a little to warm up to, but ultimately I did enjoy the new characters of Nimue and Condwiramurs. They were great vehicles for understanding Ciri’s power in greater depth. I also giggled at the implication that Ciri does truly exist, and that she might have been a character in / an inspiration for some of the Arthurian legends. I’m definitely now going to be on the look out for a white unicorn, a black horse and a girl with a scar on her cheek from now on. I’m glad I read the books, I’m most likely going to reread them at some point. But the ending… Disappointing.
“‘And they shall control the winds and be lords of the deserts. And any traveller who strays across their land shall be doomed.’ There was only one creature that line ever referred to, only one being that struck terror in hardened warriors and savvy merchants from the Maghrib to the Hind. An ancient being said to live for deceiving and terrorizing mankind. A djinn."In 18th century Cairo, Nahri survives as a pickpocket and swindler. She longs to leave the city, and does so in a way she never would a thought possible. She plunges headfirst into a magical world of Djinn that is believed to be myth by the humans. In the fantastical city Daveabad, Nahri comes closer to the family history she has never known. But while discovering her roots, she finds out that her history sits at the centre of a great political whirlwind. Meanwhile, the city is careening towards civil war, the royal family is struggling to keep old resentments from turning into violence. And prince Ali is torn between staying loyal to his family, and staying loyal to the future he wants to achieve. There are aspects about this book that I loved, and there are aspects that I hated. To start off, let it be known that the pacing was horrendous. The first 5% was great, so was the last 10% - I was pretty bored the rest of the time, it took me forever to get through. But I did love the use of Middle Eastern, and Northern African mythology. It is great to read a fantasy book that isn’t based on Western Mediaeval times. Give me anything remotely based on religious myth (Suleiman’s seal, Zoroastrian gods), and I will eat it up! On the other hand, I cannot stand when a fictional world is crippled by real life problems: the themes of racism and segregation were too much. I don’t want to feel sad about marginalized groups when I’m trying to escape reality in which I feel sad about marginalized groups. Also the word ‘Pureblood’ gives me the ick. Though, the political intrigue was amazing! It took me a while to wrap my head around the various tribes and their histories, but when I got it, I was invested. I may have screamed whenever someone (Ali) made stupid political choices. And I’m so glad the main focus was on the intrigue and not on the romance, I hated whatever happened between Nahri and Dara. Firstly, their age gap is gross. Secondly, there was no mention of anything romantic and boom, all of a sudden Nahri was into him? I don’t buy it: fleeing for your life is not really a situation conducive for romance!!! Thirdly, Nahri is too self-centred, she does not even try to understand Dara’s position in the mess she created!The end of the book would have gotten 5 stars, the middle part is worth 2 at most. So overall this book is pretty mediocre, but I do have high hopes for the sequel because I need to know what happens next. I refuse to believe that everyone who died is truly dead.
Charles IV is dead, fulfilling the cures of the Templars once and for all. This leaves the path to the throne open for Robert of Artois to place his cousin, Philippe of Valois upon it. Having committed fraud, perjury and murder in the name of the new king, Robert expects to receive a title and his full reward. But the days of betrayal are far from over and Robert is banished to England. In the land of France’s enemies vengeance sparks fresh conflict as King Edward III and his new ally prepare for war. As swords are sharpened the lion wakes and a pretender threatens France once more…To be entirely honest, I really did enjoy reading the penultimate book of this series, but it did not leave a lasting impression on me. For the life of me, I can’t remember what this book was about… After refreshing my memory a little, I remember screaming, crying, throwing up over Robert of Artois’ utter stupidity. He’s like an Icarus who flew too close to the sun – what idiot implicates himself so unnecessarily in a mess of his own creation. That stupidity was very entertaining to read. My heart did break reading about my girl Beatrice. Another independent girlboss destroyed by a man who could not care less about her. In my mind she left before she was in too deep, and is now living the witchy life of her dreams (nightmares?). And then Robert died?? How am I supposed to read the last book of this series when all of my favourite characters are now dead? The little author’s note about Druon’s own heartache of having to write this death was so incredibly cute.After just having read Thea Beckman’s trilogy with her view of the 100 year war, this felt like the ultimate crossover in historical fiction. It made me realise how well both of these authors researched the war, the complicated political background and the individual characters that made history - both of their interpretations seamlessly align with each other. Absolutely perfect for my history-obsessed little nerd brain. One more book in this series to go, and I bet I will almost immediately go back to the start to relive it all again.
As most people know, this book is the manuscript written by Humbert Humbert about, in his words, the “love” affair he had with the prepubescent Dolores “Lolita” Haze. At the time of writing, Humbert is in prison for killing a man. In flowery prose, Humbert attempts to manipulate the jury into believing that he is not a dirty paedophile, but rather a artistic, gentle man who was seduced by a salacious young girl. Humbert’s manuscript starts with explaining his predilection for young girls, then shows a short snapshot of his first marriage to eventually lead to the core of the story: his relationship with his Lolita. From marrying her mother to gain access to her, to traveling across America raping her nightly in motels – this story gives an disgusting insight into the mind of a paedophile. But ultimate it is a sad story about a horribly abused young girl, who got lost into the fantasy of her abuser. This is my second time reading this book, I first read it at 16. Back then, I knew that Humbert was the villain, and not the hopeless romantic he appears to be from the outset. Yet I could not understand the clever references Nabokov added to truly illustrate the despicable nature of Humbert. This reread truly opened my eyes to how intelligent of a book this is. I don’t think I’ve read a more cleverly constructed book in my life. Now I also fully understand the tragedy of this story. How awful it is to read about a grown man raping a child, while he is actively trying to make us believe that this was her choice. Most importantly, now I see how Dolores was entirely erased, and crafted into this creature that only exists in Humbert’s imagination: Lolita. The ending hit me more than it did last time, Dolores deserved so much more in life. Humbert Humbert is the most realistic and scariest villain I’ve read in a long time. With this better grasp of what Nabokov was trying to say with this book, I’m even more outraged with how society has taken this story and twisted it into a story about forbidden love. I remember watching the 1997 movie and enjoying the aesthetic. Now I see how they completely butchered the message, the trailer even states how it is a “love story”, excuse me? It is infuriating how Lolita has become synonymous with “a precociously seductive girl”. Just as Humbert only saw his fantasy Lolita, and not the abused Dolores, society has also completely disregarded this abused little girl. Let us not forget that Humbert Humbert is the blueprint of an unreliable narrator! If anyone ever even slightly tries to say that this book is about love, I will throw hands.
A nondescript vaguely Eastern European town languishes under a hellish heatwave. The villagers are made to believe, by their priest, that the heat is a punishment for their sins against God. They do not know that the priest is instructed to make them believe so by the lord of the luxurious manor atop the hill. In reality, Lord Villiam who is always greedy and always bored, is hoarding the water for his own selfish enjoyment. This is how things are until Marek, a disfigured shepherd’s boy finds himself the unlikely pivot in a power struggle between the haves, have-nots and the ‘divine’ that shakes the faith of all involved. Through the unsavoury characters, such as Jude the shepherd, Ina the village wet nurse and sometimes witch, Agata the nun, etc., Ottessa Mosfegh discusses faith, free will and the seven deadly sins in a disgusting yet compelling way.Mosfegh continues to write novels that have me constantly thinking: ‘Ew, what the hell?!?’ I think this is the first book that actually had me physically gagging (view spoiler)[– the cannibalism was a step too far (hide spoiler)]. This book is incredibly gruesome but you just can’t look away from it. Uncomfortably enough, the malevolence and violence feel so innately human that it’s no wonder that these people behave in the awful ways that they do. It’s like looking into a mirror and only seeing a reflection of your worst thoughts. But to be entirely honest, I don’t think I fully grasped what Ottessa was intending to say. The religious imagery was mesmerizing, especially with its Marxist undertones – it’s a sure way to get my attention. The priest especially was an interesting character with his lack of faith masked by his unbridled devotion to a man that despises everything the priesthood is supposed to stand for. Yet, the real message of these characters feels just out of reach. I think I would understand it better were I to reread this book, but I can’t go through all the disgustingness again.Nevertheless, Ottessa is a brilliant writer. As with her other novel Eileen, the atmosphere is almost like another character you have to get to know. Though the setting is incredibly bleak, like it was written in brown hues devoid of vibrancy, the writing style is astonishingly blunt and sharp. Unlike in Eileen, femininity is not at the forefront, however it does play an important role by its absence, only with the disillusionment of the people does femininity gain a place. In short, I fuck with the themes but not with the execution. I will most definitely read more of her books.
“There have been so many times when I was scared to speak up because I was afraid somebody would think I was crazy. But I’ve learned that lesson now, the hard way. You have to speak the thing that you’re feeling, even if it scares you. You have to tell your story. You have to raise your voice.” First and foremost, I love Britney. She is amazing. Adore her. This book was devastating. I knew her life as a popstar was bad, but I never could have imagined it to be this bad. Absolutely heartbreaking, I just want to hold her. After everything Britney has gone through, it feels wrong to now ‘review’ her first moment of publicly speaking up. One thing I do need to say: FUCK THE PAPARAZZI!
On the remains of the battlefields of “A Storm of Swords”, the survivors are left to pick op the pieces. After Tywin’s death, Kings Landing is on the verge of imploding. Cersei, haunted by a prophecy received in childhood, declares herself regent. Rather than ruling the country, her mind is focused on the Tyrells. Simultaneously, the Iron Islands are also dealing with a power vacuum – who follows Balon? Brother or daughter. Family relations are equally strenuous in Dorne after the death/murder of Oberyn. Is the answer revenge or patience? Meanwhile, Sansa forgoes her Stark identity and is slowly uncovering the true intentions of Petyr Baelish. Similarly, Arya also learns how to let go of her name and herself. And then there is Sam, having to overcome his fears to do right by those he loves.This is by far my most favourite book of the series. Firstly, Cersei’s character is amazing. In previous books other characters have consistently seen her as in control, but boy is she paranoid, irrational and downright crazy – I love her for it. Secondly, the intrigue is so multifaceted. On the one hand the stories is about kings/queens, wars and their politicking with massive consequences, but at the same time it is also played out within the family unit. All their choices are equally, if not more, influenced by how the relationships around them are. For example, Cersei making awful decisions just to spite the Tyrells, or Victorian who literally does the exact opposite of what his brother wants because he hates him. Thirdly, I love anything Dorne related. This book was in sore need of a feminine, powerful and confident character: Arianne Martell. I am living for her. In the same breath, I also adore Alayne: she is learning to play the game and damn she is good. All 3 previous books lead to this amazing fourth book. Storylines are gathering, it feels like the ultimate war/solution is coming now that (almost) all players with their motives are put on the board.
Reading this book felt like finally seeing the thing in the corner of your eye. You’ve always known it was there, and finally you have found the words to express what you knew to be true. That women are disproportionately disadvantaged in our world is (to me, at least) common knowledge, but when discussing the issue I could never get any deeper that anecdotal evidence. Finally, I feel like I have a grasp of actual examples, with clear evidence to prove my point. This is why this book such an important read for everybody, from CEO to unpaid stay-at-home moms. We should all unite in the common effort to finally see women for who they are, and help them with what they need.I can’t help but also feel incredibly sad, maybe even discouraged after reading this book. Especially now that I have a daughter the injustices feel more unfair, and it feels more pressing than ever to change our world. I never want her to feel less heard, less important and less safe just because she was born a girl. But as Perez herself says: “women simply don’t forget that women exist as easily as men often seem to do”, I do truly believe in the resilience of women, we can fight this and win.
“And don’t be fobbed off Jenna. Because I don’t doubt for a second that someone in this town knows what’s happened to those girls and has kept quiet about it for twenty years. It’s time to spook them into revealing themselves.” In a small town twenty years ago, three girls disappeared at the site of a car accident, the fourth girl Olivia was left behind, stuck behind the wheel. Now Jenna arrives in town to shed a new light on this mysterious case, and record a podcast while doing so. The people of the town are reluctant to speak to her, Olivia most of all. With the little pieces of information Jenna does uncover, she realizes that the mystery is farther reaching than she could have imagined. Together with a local police officer she’s soon in the midst of it all, and its clear that the mystery that started twenty years ago is not done developing. For the most part, I enjoyed this thriller – I could not put it down. The characters were all interesting, with complete backgrounds that gave context to their choices. I particularly enjoyed Jenna’s backstory, and her struggle between wanting to maintain the family unit and finding her own happiness. Her love for her son was also wonderfully woven into her thought process. The only character that seemed a little too one dimensional was Wesley – he was a straight up villain for no reason. Nothing about him was subtle whatsoever. Douglas beautifully captured the atmosphere of the English countryside: one second I’m enveloped in its cosiness of kettles, jumpers and wellies and the next second I felt the oppressive nature of the relentless rain and wind. I was completely sucked into the story. Additionally, Douglas masterfully offers new pieces of the puzzle at the end of chapters, basically forcing you to keep on reading. It was great.Yet, I cannot give this thriller 5 stars. I enjoyed everything up till the last quarter of the book. The flashbacks set in Thailand really intrigued me, but felt slightly disconnected from the rest of the novel (hated reading entire pages in italics though). In the end, I did not like the resolution of the mystery. Making literally every character (save Dale) complicit, takes away from the cleverness of the unfolding of the mystery. On top of that, I did not particularly care for the supernatural elements sprinkled in. Madame Tovey makes no sense in the context of an actual realistic English town. The hints to alien abduction, magic and whatever else was entirely unnecessary. I feel that there could have been different ways to muddle the truth, (view spoiler)[ like pretending John Paul was alive when they knew he wasn’t. Regarding John-Paul, I did not like how Anastacia turned out to be the killer. Her characterization from meek, shy girl to stone cold drug dealer and killer gave me whiplash. But like mother, like daughter I guess… Again, whiplash, how can scared, traumatized Olivia kill her only friend? (hide spoiler)] I have definitely read worse thrillers, so it was alright.
‘My name is David Wong. My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours. You may not want to know about the things you'll read on these pages, about the sauce, about Korrock, about the invasion, and the future. But it's too late. You touched the book. You're in the game. You're under the eye. It is crucial you keep one thing in mind: none of this is my fault.’I have read weird books before, but this one, is almost too weird. From a drug called ‘soy sauce’, to a talking dog (LOVE HER) and having phone conversations through a bratwurst – it just kept getting weirder. The language used very much suited the wackiness, David’s perspective and way of talking about it is so resigned, as a reader you can't help but adopt that attitude - just got to roll with the punches. I especially enjoyed how throughout everything, John and David were still found the time to argue, how best friends do, about the most irrelevant things ever (the penis conversation). I did not expected it, but in the end I loved the characters. I even kicked my feet, giggling at the romantic subplot. And it has to be mentioned, the story felt so aggressively American, with malls, too big convention centres and, of course, Las Vegas – not helping in dispelling my conviction that Americans are fucked up. And yet, the weirdness is not what I remember mostly about this book. What stands out in my memory, is that in between the whacky shit, there were so many very boring, too slow passages. So, I guess it was kind of okay, kind of scary and kind of entertaining – definitely not a ‘good book’ in the literary sense. But, I was confused 95% of the time. I think I was too focused on understanding every little detail of the plot to just lean in and let the story take me wherever it wanted to. In the end, it turned out, the little subplot are not even that important for understanding the overall story. Stupidly enough, I had already bought two sequels before reading this book. So, I feel forced to continue reading this series. I might revisit this book, before starting the second. Just to refresh my memory, and this time I will just savour the crazy ride of this book. And I bet that will raise my rating from 3 stars, to at least 3,5.
What an helluva book this was! It took me a while to get into the flow of it, to be really honest halfway through I was almost getting bored. But I’m so glad that I stuck with it. This is one of those books that you have to finish to fully appreciate the story. Only near the end did it dawn upon me that this book basically chronicles how Holden deals with grief. The ending was heart wrenching my beautiful. Without it, I would not have rated it 4 stars. I truly think that the brilliance of this story is gonna stick with me for a while.
The Empire of Parijatdvipa is ruled by a religiously zealous, cruel and despotic Emperor. In the name of his religion, Chandra attempted to burn his sister Princess Malini alive. She refused, and now she is imprisoned in an ancient temple. Though she is constantly sedated to keep her from escaping, Malini dreams of vengeance. Meanwhile maidservant Priya uses what little means she has to help suffering children. She has a complicated past which she tries to leave behind her. Soon enough, Priya realizes that there is no running from who you are. While the unrest in the empire is growing, Malini and Priya’s destinies become irrevocably interlinked. This novel is a masterpiece! I tore through it, and loved everything about it. The Jasmine Throne gave everything The City of Brass thought it was giving. Again, any fantasy world, based on non-European cultures, with a complicated political and religious system is automatically a winner in my book. The world truly came alive through the beautiful invocative descriptions, and the interesting characters that inhabit it. Usually, I’m not the greatest fan of having multiple P.O.Vs, because the overarching story tends to get lost, but Suri masterfully picked up all storylines and gave them a combined, explosive end. All characters were multifaceted with great motivations, and fears and wants. I would die for Rukh, his story is so beautifully sad. But Bhumika is my absolute favourite, I’m rooting for her always. Anybody who knows me, knows that I’m not a romance girly, I avoid romance books like the plague. But this cute little sapphic angsty romance? I’m living!!!! The angst had me shivering, screaming, tearing my hair out. I want my own waterfall, hair brushing moment. What I enjoyed the most about the romance, is how the romantic feelings did not surpass the individual goals they have. The ending was so bittersweet, but realistic to the characters – I loved it. This is the type of book that makes me so anxious to read the sequel, I want to know what happens next, but I’m so scared that it might ruin the love I have for this story. In any case, I’m ready to scribble more hearts in the margins for my sapphic queens.
First, holy fuck. Second, what the fuck? Reading this book was quite the ride, a terrifying, mind boggling but amazing ride. This novel is written from the perspective of a woman who is on a road trip through an incredibly remote and rural area to meet her boyfriend’s, Jake’s, parents. While traveling, the woman cannot deny that she’s “thinking of ending things”. Nevertheless she meets the parents, and their meeting over dinner is not quite what it seems like. On the way back, they get caught in a snowstorm. And it is in this snowstorm that the full eeriness of the novel comes into play. Again, things are not what they seem to be, and in an chase that borders on an fight between life or death, the truth finally comes to light.It is not often that I have to put a book down because of the sheer anxiety it causes me, but this book: it was honestly terrifying. The progression from the mundane beginning, to the absolutely wild and astounding ending was subtle, yet provoking. Early on in the novel, I already got the feeling that something was off. Every page, Jake got more odd and standoffish. The dinner reminded me of “Get Out” (without the racial tension). It had the same oppressive atmosphere, of knowing that something is off but not knowing what. All this pent up anxiety came to explosion in the most terrifying and horrid way. The last few pages at the high school got my heart beating like no other book has ever done. It’s a good thing I’m writing this review a day after finishing this book, had I written it right away, the review would not have been so positive. Admittedly, the ending of the book was confusing, I had no idea what had happened. After taking a second, and rereading the last pages, the sheer brilliance of the story hit me. This ending needs time to be digested properly. The ending is also an invite to read the entire novel again. Because of the pleasant flow, easy language and relatable main character, it’s very tempting to do so. I’m sure the reread will solidify that the Iain Reed is an incredibly clever story writer.
London, 1984 (obviously). Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth, and Big Brother is watching him. Big Brother is watching everyone, step one toe out of line and the Thought Police will uncover every act of betrayal you’ve ever even thought about. When Winston finds love with Julia, he realizes that life can be so much more than strict adherence to (nonsensical) rules. Despite their fears of getting caught, Winston and Julia start to question the Party. But Big Brother is watching, even the dark corners of your mind are not safe. Because for those with original thoughts, there is Room 101. It is incredible to think how Orwell wrote this novel in 1949, and how it not only made scarily accurate predictions on the Cold War, but how it also still rings true for 2024 in regards to government surveillance. This was a eerie read for sure. And obviously, I knew that 1984 continues to leave lasting marks on (popular) culture, but I had no idea how many pieces of media I have convinced over the years had references to this work. I learn something new every day. Though, I do think that I got less out if it than I could have, purely because I read too fast to appreciate all clever details. Because of that, it probably also took me longer than necessary to fully get the significance of, for example, the Newspeak. Additionally, midway through I did struggle with keeping my focus while reading – parts of it were really boring to me. But again, I bet that is my own fault for not giving the book all of my attention as it deserves. Yet, because of how claustrophobic this book made me feel, I don’t think I’m going to reread this any time, so I'll just have to live with the fact that I only got half of the story. For a book that’s 75 years old, it is a small miracle that the twist at the end had not been spoiled to me yet. And damn, what a twist that was! Guess I was just as naïve as Winston, and took Julia too much at face value. Either way, some minds see so much more of how the world works than others, and Orwell is so very clearly one of those incredible minds.
Bought this book thinking it was going to be a fictional novel, but I’m glad it wasn’t. This historical work of non-fiction beautifully describes the difficult marriage and subsequent divorce of Isabella Robinson. To escape her marriage, she falls in love/gets infatuated with other men in her life, most notable Dr. Edward Lane. Isabella, as many other women of her time, writes down her most intimate thoughts and feelings in a diary. It is this diary that causes the her societal downfall. Not only does this book give a glimpse into Isabella’s life and mental state, it also places her as a woman in the wider context of Victorian society. An society in which a woman’s sexuality must be a sign of insanity. It illustrates how it was to be a woman in a time where women had no legal standing/ rights whatsoever, it illustrates how little choices women in that time period had.This was such an interesting read to me. I’m grateful to be a woman in the 21st century, but this book made me realize that many outdated societal norms still play a huge role in our modern world, feminism still has a long way to go. I also very much loved reading about big historical figures (Charles Darwin) in a more humanized context, not just as a revolutionary thinkers but as actual human beings.
Somewhere in time and space, two factions the Garden and the Agency are wrapped up in an all-consuming time war. Both factions attempt to weave time in such a way that their vision of the past, present and future is the only one to exist. Enter Blue and Red, agents for the Garden and Agency respectively. They are specially created to fight this war: be it saving lives so the descendants can alter the future in significant ways, or killing them for the exact same reason. Red and Blue are nothing but cogs in an everlasting clock, until Blue reaches out and writes Red a letter. Their correspondence starts almost as a new dimension on which to fight their war. Quickly enough, their letters form a bridge between worlds that have never touched. The more purple Red and Blue both become, the more they realize that there is more to ‘life’ than fighting, and slowly they grow the power to carve out a piece of time just for the two of them. I’ve seen this book recommended so many times, by people who I know have a similar taste in books – I started reading with high expectations. The first few chapters/letters I thought I had made a mistake picking up this book. I had a hard time getting used to the lyrical language, I had to reread multiple passages to fully grasp what was going on. Retrospectively, I was probably too tired when starting this book. This book is not particularly filled with action, it takes getting through the slow, but important stage-setting of the beginning to fully appreciate the ending. Only mid-way through, when the pace of the novel picks up, did I grasp the language structure, and could I enjoy the wonderful story. And wonderful it is, the vibe is whimsical and lyrical, with a touch of disillusionment about the world/reality. This book touches your heartstrings to ultimately ripping them out completely. I feel like this book can only be fully appreciated for its masterwork after you’ve finished reading it – it practically begs to be reread again. And I will comply, I’m sure I missed many details of this subtle yet enticing novel. Although the romance between Red and Blue stands at the core of the story, it does not take the centre of attention. To me, it seems that the relationships they have with themselves, their places of origin and their roles in the war takes precedence. The understanding they have about those personal relationships is what fuels their romance: without the disillusionment they could not have been together. It is this complexity that I enjoyed the most, nothing is straightforward yet everything is. It is incredibly difficult to review a mosaic of poetic language sculpted into a heart-warming romance: I just loved it.
** spoiler alert ** For the past year Eloise has had a secret, a secret correspondence with a man (Sir Phillip) she’s never met. And now he has proposed marriage. Eloise knows she can’t marry a man she’s never met, yet she has to know, is he the one for her? So in all haste she leaves London to figure it out. Sir Phillip is nothing like she expected, he’s a large brute of a man, rough and rugged, totally unlike the man she used to see in London. But yet, when he looks at her, the world stops in its tracks. Is this imperfect man perfect for her?Say it with me now: fuck sir Phillip. Lucky Benedict is officially no longer the man I hate the most, Phillip can now proudly take that top spot. My god, what a manipulative piece of shit he is. Honestly, I should’ve known that he would suck the moment it was revealed that he never told Eloise he had kids. What the fuck? Especially, after he keeps on repeating how he wants a wife because the children need a mother. Phillip just say because he is too cowardly to be an actual dad to them… Such a romantic way to describe the woman you want to marry: “she’s a good mother”. How about actually liking her for her? Throughout the book, Eloise had to bend over backwards to be how he wanted her to be, just so he can fuck off and play in the dirt? Boy, hire a proper nanny, instead of dragging Eloise down. DisgustingThe mental health representation in this book is absolutely abysmal, and don’t come to me with: ‘it is accurate for that time period’. This book (like all the other Bridgerton books) is filled with anachronisms, it really would not have hurt to be slightly more empathetic towards Marina. She is the one who struggled and ultimately died because of depression, but boohoo little Phillip needs all the compassion. Fuck no. And don’t get me started on the plot resolution: Phillip essentially telling Eloise that she is never allowed to have negative emotions because that would make him suffer. Weak ass piece of shit. If I were one of the twins, I’d never forgive my father for neglecting me for years, especially since he was aware that their mother was also neglecting them. Why is his discomfort so centred throughout the story, I couldn’t care less. Better yet, it pissed me the fuck off. I’m so upset that the high of book 4 was followed by the low-low that is this book. Fingers crossed for Francesca’s story.
“In another world, they are sleeping. They are setting the table, or jogging through the park, they are watching the news or helping with math homework, they are working late, walking the dog, pulling clogs of hair from the shower drain. In another world this is a regular evening for Izzy, Angela, Lila,, Jenny. But they do not live in that world – and they do not live in this one. ”Serial killer Ansel Packer is scheduled to die in twelve hours, but he does not want to die; he wants to be celebrated, understood. But this book is not about him, but about the women in his life. We meet his mother, Lavender, a seventeen-year-old girl pushed to desperation; Hazel, twin sister to Ansel’s wife, inseparable since birth, forced to watch helplessly as her sister’s relationship threatens to devour them all; and finally, Saffy, the detective hot on his trail, who has devoted herself to bringing bad men to justice but struggles to see her own life clearly. As the clock ticks down, these three women sift through the choices that culminate in tragedy, exploring the rippling fissures that such destruction inevitably leaves in its wake.An absolutely brilliant, heartbreaking but oh so important book! Especially in a society where serial killers are seen as entertainment, not as the monsters that they are. This book examines exactly that; it unravels the familiar narrative of the American serial killer. Dissecting our system of justice, and our cultural obsession with crime stories. asking readers to consider the false promise of looking for meaning in the psyches of violent men. I cried so many times, especially at the story of Lavender, she deserves all the peace in the world. And Blue, can’t think about how betrayed she must have felt without tearing up. The waterfall of tears could not be stopped at the final chapter. The spotlight is finally unapologetically shining on the real victims, the people who should be celebrated at the centre of it all. That chapter haunted me for weeks after finishing the book. Men like Ansel, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, etc., do not deserve to be celebrated/remembered/understood, what they did is heinous and unforgivable. It destroyed the lives of all those around them, especially the victims: they should be seen, understood and celebrated. I also very much enjoyed the sole focus on the women in his life. Still too often women are blamed for the actions done by men. Whether it be a mother who should have raised her son better, or the wife who should have known better than to marry a psychopath. Men are remembered for doing the crimes, and women are blamed for not stopping them – either way, the responsibility is never placed on the right shoulders. I will remember this book for a long time to come.
This novel forms the third instalment of the Accursed Kings series. The previous novel chronicled the establishment, or the lack thereof, of King Louis X rule. After the death of his first wife, Louis is free to marry again. His desires are fixed on the beautiful Princess Clemence of Hungary. After a dangerous travel to France, Clemence soon enough figures out that the life of a Queen is far from glamorous, and her husband is not the strong King she thought him to be. Louis does attempt to assert his strength through a war in Flanders, this turns out to be a complete disaster. Meanwhile, other forces of the court are trying to use Louis X’s power for their own personal gain. And one of those forces is convinced that the power can be better used in their favour if it was not Louis X holding it. Is the curse coming back to haunt Louis too?The second book was a disappointment to me compared to the first, this third book pulled me right back to my initial enthusiasm. The characters are grand, clearly defined, easily understood but definitely part of their respective time periods. I could easily imagine the wealth, the courtly culture but also the tragedy of the ‘normal’ every day people. The language of the book is straightforward, even the most difficult political intrigues are described in an easy to understand way. As a reader, the decline of Capet family line feels inevitable, and it is compelling to see these powerful figures dig their own graves. Druon has the ability to package potential stale history in a colourful and interesting way – he brings the middle ages back alive. I couldn’t put this book down – I’m more than excited to tread the fourth book of this series.
This military fantasy novel follows the story of Fang Runin “Rin”. Rin, an orphan of the second Poppy War, grew up in a poor southern town. To escape her bleak future, Rin enters the yearly Keju that she surprisingly aced. Which allows her to go to Sinegard, the most elite military school in the empire. Unlike her classmates, Rin is a dark-skinned peasant girl without any prior education – she has to work like never before to be secured of her spot at the school. With the help of her odd quirky teacher, she discovers and masters her rare spiritual powers. When Rin’s future finally seems bright, the Third Poppy War breaks out: the war destroys more than she ever could have imagined.I loved this book! I knew it was going to be good, but did not expect this amazing. Once I started, I could not put it down. What impressed me the most is how complex all characters are, truly felt like I understood all of them. Every character had its place, without coming across as empty plot development (except for maybe a few Cike members). I’m usually not a big fan of the “superhero teenager” trope, but here it was so fleshed out that it made sense. Even when Rin had a position of power, she remained a rash teenager which I appreciated. Additionally, the plot progression for such a trope was still unexpected, I would not have guessed that Rin’s school story would be what it was. Not only the plot was amazing, the world building was also phenomenal. For me to get into fantasy, the fantastical elements need to be imbedded into a world that has enough realistic aspects to help with the visualization of the fantasy. Kuang added enough realistic elements of war, disease and poverty that help ground the fantasy. I loved the realism surrounding addiction, be it a drug, praise or self-harm addiction, Kuang showed the rawness without being disrespectful. This book definitely does not shy away from the pain, and gore of war: I was shocked by how graphic the slaughter was described, it truly was one of the most horrific things I have ever read. R.F. Kuang is definitely one of the smartest writers I have ever read. The (military) history so intricate and full, she blesses us with entire mythologies, cultures, and religions. The passage on the role of religion among different people made me so happy. Kuang clearly did loads of research into religious studies to be able to write something like this. So impressive. On top of that, the characters interact with their world in such an intelligent way. The ending had me screaming, crying, throwing up – Rin’s internal monologues, and the way she tries to find a spot for herself in the world make her the best character I’ve read in a long while.
This third novel of the Outlander series picks up after Claire finds out Jamie survived Culloden. After finding him in history, she decides to abandon her daughter and go back to him. Jamie had lived a life he refuses to tell Claire about, until he’s absolutely forced to tell her. Then their nephew Ian is kidnapped and they go on an racist adventure to get him back in the West Indian Colonies. It is a miracle they had time to rescue him because they were almost to horny to focus. I hated all 870 pages of this monstrosity. There was so much wrong with this novel. What’s up with all the racism? So completely unnecessary in a historical FICTION, even if it’s mostly set in the 18th century. Diana is showing her true colors, I feel. The 3 casually mentioned N-words - inexcusable; the “Asian men are sexual freaks” stereotype - disgusting; the “all black people look alike” sentiment - abhorrent. Claire is every white savior’s wet dream. Her anguish for owning a slave, boo-fucking-hoo. And then she has the nerve to talk about him in such an infantilizing way? Nah, fam. If the sentiments about a gay character in the 18th century are so forgiving, there is absolutely no reason to make the 20th century scholar so blatantly racist! I never would’ve imagined I would hate Jamie, but here we are. Why did I have to read about him raping a teenage girl? Yes she was insufferable, but she clearly said no! It was gross. Not only is Jamie a rapist, he was also a lying son of a bitch! He was not once, but twice too selfish to tell Claire the truth. I am so done with him. Honorable mention, what was Diana thinking when she wrote that Fergus married a girl LITERALLY half his age? He has no business marrying a 15 year old GIRL. Also, the pacing of this novel felt completely off. It took so long for them to find Jamie in history, but then it took no time for Claire to decide to leave behind her barely adult daughter forever? And then I have to believe she’s a good mother? No. It also felt so off to read so many sex scenes when Ian was gone, taken to God knows where. Near the end of the novel I was disgusted every time they hinted at their constant horniness. Honestly, I deserve compensation for finishing this.
** spoiler alert ** What in the actual fuck did I just read? This was crazy, and widely disappointing. Not that I had particularly high hopes for this book, but still... What the fuck? In all honesty, as with the previous book, for the life of me I can’t tell you what this book is actually about. Nothing happened, while simultaneously everything happened. I don’t know how Olivie pulls that off in her books, it’s a talent but not one I particularly enjoy. I just detest how after so many hundred of pages, the ending of the trilogy implies that all of this has been for nothing, and that a new group of power hungry medians can pop up to do this all over again. Fuck off.This whole book was grating, but the thing that broke the camel’s back was Parisa’s mental breakdown. Her world shattering breakdown after finding one (1) grey hair, I couldn’t do it anymore. If I were anything like her, I should’ve killed my self at 17 when my hair started to fall out due to exam stress… Just no. I also wholeheartedly hated how the plot forced them all to be somehow in love with each other? Like why did it all have to boil down to sex? Why not use platonic love? It just leaves a disgusting taste in my mouth. Additionally, so many of the pairings made no sense, like Reina and Parisa barely exchanged any words in the three books but I have to believe that Reina is madly in love with Parisa? No fucking way, leave me alone. Dishonourable mention to the Atlas pity party chapters littered throughout the book, and Callum supposedly not being a Tory, you can’t convince me of that at all. Lastly, a major criticism that is not about the story itself. Olivie uses way too many parentheses. Why does almost every page have at least 2 or 3 sets? One page had 6?!? That’s bad editing. I’m so glad it is over. These books don’t even deserve a spot in my bookcase. I’m tired and need a nap.
This book came highly recommend, my mom loved it. The topic of this novel really attracted me, but in the end I wasn’t convinced by the story. To be honest, I find Cora to be quite insufferable… I would’ve expected a deeper layer of trauma, since she’s a runaway slave. She was too confident in her relations with white people and she also appeared to be knowledgeable about to world for me to believer her to be a young uneducated runaway slave. The topic of this book is really important, and should be understood by everybody, but this book did not move me in the way I wanted it to
This thriller is set on an weathered island just off the Irish coast. On this rough stage, Jules is determined to have her picture perfect wedding, marrying the charismatic and famous tv-host Will. The day before, the most important guests are already arriving on the island, with specific focus on: Hannah, the wife of the bride’s best man; Olivia, the bridesmaid and sister of the bride; and Johno; the groom’s best man and his childhood friend. Soon enough it becomes clear that all of the guests are keeping secrets, and that they might be more connected with each other than they realize. When secrets are slowly forced out in the open, the tensions rise. One person will not leave the island alive.I’m writing this review a few weeks after finishing the book, and admittedly I’m struggling to remember any of the characters and their plots. I even forgot who the murder victim was. Safe to say, this book doesn’t leave a lasting impression. What I do remember is that the story progresses incredibly slowly, and that the multiple perspectives were kind of confusing. At the beginning of the novel I struggled with discerning between the different characters, and their respective secrets. Additionally, the constant hinting to the bigger picture, while taking forever to actually get to that bigger picture was a turn off. I remember guessing multiple secrets correctly, which takes away the shock at the ultimate murder. Lastly, the friends of the groom were the most insufferable characters I’ve read in a while. Many of the other characters have to deal with tragedy and other difficult storylines, but these misogynistic assholes get away with everything they’ve done in their youth and continue to do. Yeah no, I’m not a fan. This book is alright for a quick thriller fix, but it definitely isn’t the best of its genre.
In a small college town, Samantha Heather Mackey follows a writer’s programme at the prestigious Warren university. In her all female writing group, Samantha is the outsider who despises but is also intimidated by the four other girls in the group. These girls form a (too tight) monolith, exclusively call each other “bunny” and can’t go a day without each other. Surprisingly, Samantha is invited to join their group. Soon enough, Samantha is so intertwined with the Bunnies and their ‘workshops’ – she cannot get out. Eventually, nothing is what it seems, reality is shaky, and Samantha has to find herself again. What did I just read? This was really weird, and not in a fun/interesting way. Honestly, I don’t really know what to think about it, so I’m just writing whatever thoughts I have about this book. Firstly, I hate it when a book relies too heavily on pop culture references to create the world. I don’t want to think about Frozen, or Game of Thrones when reading a unrelated novel. In hindsight, I realize that the pop culture references where necessary to understand the eventual big plot twist, but still I would have liked it more without. Secondly, why were all the emojis written out in words? Just no. I hate it. On the other hand, occasionally, Samantha was a very relatable character. Her need to belong, and always feeling like you want to go “home” without actually meaning your house-home, me too girl. Honestly, I can’t really say if I liked this book, or I didn’t. I think it was just too confusing for the sake of being confusing, and trying too hard to make a convoluted point that never went anywhere. Or maybe I’m too stupid to get it. And frankly, I don’t care enough to want to try and figure out what it all means. (view spoiler)[ Section with spoilers: I do have my theories about Samantha’s apparent powers, and how the Bunnies tried to use her for themselves. Seeing how Samantha is an unreliable narrator, I think the Bunnies are exaggerated, and that everything they did in Duchess’ house was not as gory as Samantha thought it was (Duchess’ attic being normal at the end). And how Ava might be a Darling, or possibly only exist in Samantha’s mind. And how Jonah is also a creation from mud. But honestly, I don’t understand the point of it. Is the conclusion truly only: Samantha is mentally ill? A disappointing takeaway from a confusing book. (hide spoiler)]
The fourth novel of the Accursed Kings series follows up after the suspicious death of Louis X – only a few months after he ascended the throne. For the first time in a long time, the King did not have a male heir lined up to take the crown after his death. All the powerful members of the court are clawing each other’s eyes out to get to the Regency first. After (finally) forcing the cardinals to pick a new Pope, Louis X brother, Phillipe of Poitiers also proves victorious in grabbing the Regency. That is, until Clémence gives birth to the late king’s child. Again, the power hungry wolves will have to find a way to deal with this baby that might throw a wrench in their plans for the future. I have got to admit, this book is so far my favourite novel in this series. The drama, intrigue and dirty politics were absolutely fantastic. It’s been a while since I’ve read book 3, I was scared I was going to struggle with getting back into the story. Luckily, Druon has a subtle way of reiterating what happened previously. This book is a perfectly continuation of the story, while also being interesting in its own right. The first line: “Queens wore white mourning” sucked me in immediately, and the rest of the book did not let go. I have finally mastered how to read this book without struggling with all the names and titles of irrelevant characters: just skip over them. Additionally, this book Druon really did not hold back with his sarcastic/funny comments about the antics of the characters – I laughed out loud multiple times. Though some parts were still slightly slow and/or boring, I really enjoyed reading this. and I’m very excited to read book 5.While reading the earlier chapters, I fell even more in love with Guccio and Marie’s story line. As an annotation I even wrote: “if Marie and Guccio do not get a happy ending, I will riot’ and believe, I rioted. Without any spoilers, their story is one of the most heart wrenching things I’ve read in a long while. I had to take a break after *that* chapter, it broke me. I very much enjoyed how this novel also placed the spotlight on women trying to play the political game in a man-dominated world. Mauhaut might be infamous, but you can’t deny that she is a bad bitch. Do got to say, I’m kind of done with Robert of Artois, we got it: you hate your aunt and will destroy the world just to hurt her. I may be hoping for his downfall next novel, I can’t wait.
I bought this book years ago - I liked the cover. I had no idea what I would be in for. This book follows a family in their holiday month of august, across multiple years (2000-2003). During those years the children are born and grow up, and the elderly grandparents inch towards death. The parents Patrick and Mary both have to deal with the realities of parenthood, providing safe childhoods for their sons while they also still needing to heal from their own traumatic childhoods. Inevitably, this is accompanied with strive between themselves and with themselves. Essentially, this book gives a raw account of generational trauma, and the identity struggle between being a parent and simultaneously your own individual. Usually, I read books to escape everyday life, for the time that I read I don’t have to think about reality. This book almost forced me to take in it’s message, and use that to reflect upon my own life. So while I can say that the book is beautifully written, it has amazing pieces of prose, I did not enjoy reading it. Patrick’s anger at his childhood, sarcasm towards the world and the substance abuse to deal with it all, was a little too familiar for comfort. Similarly, Mary’s struggle to juggle her identity of being an (overly) attentive mother, and having to be an attentive wife to an inattentive husband, hit a little too close to home. Still, I give this novel a rating of 3 stars, but solely for the appealing use of language, and textual flow of the novel. I bet this book would be a hit for people who don’t mind being confronted with the brutality of reality.
This was a surprisingly entertaining read! In this book, that sits between nonfiction and fiction, Stephen Fry has compiled the origin stories of the Greek primordial gods, Titans and Olympians and all the shenanigans they get up to in the world they created. Though some of the stories are far from family friendly, Fry handles these difficult topics in a delicate way – he does not shy away from the hideous, but is quick to condemn heinous acts. At the same time he offers the ancient context in which the stories were understood. All Gods and Godesses are given their time to shine, so as a reader you will quickly feel familiar with their sotries. the language is easy to understand and evogative: the ancient stories come to life, they are modern and applicable even to life today. At the end of the book, you will comfortably know the basics of ancient Greek myth: the creaton of the world, the Gods/Godesses and their relation to the human world. Fry gives you the tools to discern how stories became myth, legend and/or religion. I highly recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in Greek mythology. I absolutely loved reading this book. At first I was scared to become overwhelmed with the sheer amount of spirits, titans and gods of the classic Greek pantheon, but Fry comprehensibly introduces everybody and their specific characteristics – it made me feel smart. This book is absolutely jam packed with so many interesting nuggets of information. It is general knowledge that our modern western societies are heavily influenced by the ancient Greek and Roman societies, yet I had know idea how deep this influence went until reading all the language facts Fry offers: it was mind boggling. More importantly, this book feels like a warm hug. Or like, sitting near the fire listening to your quirky and eccentric uncle telling you stories. I felt cosy reading this. Fry clearly has so much love and admiration for the human race, it shines through the pages. The Greek Gods might be jealous, fickle and violent, Fry talks about them in such a way that you can’t help but like them, well maybe except Zeus. This positive worldview is so infectious, reading this book felt like falling in love with the hope, preservation, and imagination of the human race.
Ellie was her mother’s golden child, all set for a wonderful future with good grades, a nice family and a golden boyfriend. That all went away the day she disappeared. For more than a decade, her mom Laurel struggled with accepting what is and moving on. Then she meets charismatic Floyd and his peculiar daughter Poppy. It seems as if they hold the key to her new start in life. Yet, Laurel cannot shake the feeling that they somehow hold the final puzzle pieces to figuring out what happened to Ellie all this years ago. And thus enfolds a strange story of motherhood, love, possessiveness and too many secrets to count. I like a thriller once in a while as a palate cleanser, unfortunately this thriller was too bland to cleanse much of anything. The premise of the story is very promising, the ordinary London setting was sufficiently shrouded in a sense of eeriness. The characters were set up alright, I was mainly intrigued by Noelle. All this potential went absolutely nowhere the second I guessed the entire plot not even one third into the book. Until the last chapter I held out hope that there would be an unexpected twist, to no avail. Beside the ‘thriller’ aspect, this book does offer some interesting takes on grief, and it’s effects on different people and on parenthood, especially on the relationships between mothers and daughters. With a limited amount of parents/children, Lisa Jewel does manage to showcase wide array of relationships. I was most impressed with how Jewell illustrated how grief affected Laurel as a mother and how in turn that affected her children: the passage where Laurel finally realizes how she hadn’t seen Hanna as an individual was heartbreaking. Overall, this was an alright book, it reads quickly but has no lasting impression - just bland.
This mystery starts with the newly married couple Gwenda and Giles. Ahead of her husband, Gwenda travels across England looking for a house to settle into to. In the picturesque seaside town of Dillmouth, she finds the Hillside House. Surprisingly to her, the house seems awfully familiar. She might have been there before, and witnessed something no little girl should ever witness: a grisly murder. Now, Gwenda, Giles and (the queen) Miss Marple awake the sleeping murder and start on the trail of a crime committed twenty years ago. This is unironically one of the best thrillers/mysteries I have ever read. Agatha Christie deserves her spot on the wall of fame, without a doubt. I enjoyed every single second of reading this. The one grave sin a mystery can commit, is allowing readers to guess the plot before the grand reveal. Throughout this novel, I thought I had guessed the plot multiple times, I was convinced that every guess was better than the last. I was truly, fully shocked when everything was revealed, would not have guessed it in a million years. Agatha is brilliant in setting out a (false) trail of hints that makes you look one way, while she’s simultaneously setting out another trail that leads to the true answer. On top of that, she does all of this in a writing style that is so easy to read, so immersive and very funny. I was flabbergasted and so impressed.This book was originally published 1976, and the story is set in the 1940s, so of course there are going to be societal ideas that outdated to us now – the ideas surrounding mental health are not that great. But, Miss Marple is a modern feminist queen! (view spoiler)[ I loved how the plot is essentially a message for the freedom of women, and against the oppressive “love” men place on them. I loved how Miss Marple defended Helen until the very end, as in her words: “she was a perfectly normal young girl who wanted to have fun.” (hide spoiler)] I absolutely adored Miss Marple. On the other hand, I did not care for Giles – his male presence was unnecessary. Gwenda was a sweetheart, and her backstory was surprisingly tragic. Poor girl deserves all the good in her future. This book grabbed me from start to finish: the plot, writing style, the characters – everything was great. I’m definitely going to read more of Agatha Christie’s work.
This dark, bleak and cold novel follows the story of terminally lonely, awkwardly self-obsessed, sexually repressed and emotionally stunted Eileen, as told by her older self. At 24, Eileen lives with her drunk father in her disgustingly messy, dilapidated childhood home. She is stuck in a routine of buying booze for her dad, and working as a secretary at a reform school (prison) for young boys. To disrupt the monotony of her daily live, she shoplifts and stalks the attractive prison guard Randy. Though she dreams of leaving her lonesome prison to reinvent herself in a big city, she never actually takes the necessary steps – that is until the charismatic, beautiful Rebecca blows in like new wind forcing Eileen to make choices she never would have made before. This is not the type of book you pick up for its action packed plot, in all honesty barely anything happens. This book is brilliant for its meticulous character study. The character Eileen makes the entire novel - she is one of the most unlikeable characters I’ve ever read, and I love her for it. Moshfegh does not shy away from showing the ugly, on the contrary, she leans into it. It is so refreshing to read a female character who is nothing like the stereotypical ‘good woman’ that is so often depicted. Women can be just as abominable, unattractive and morally grey like men. Eileen thoughts are uncomfortable, and downright revolting, but Moshfegh forces you to understand and empathize with her. Eileen may not be good, but damn do I understand her thoughts, and actions. Additionally, the New England atmosphere Moshfegh creates gives this book a grim and dreary vibe that fits perfectly with the introspective, and lonely nature of Eileen. From the very first chapter (that last sentence: “this is the story of how I disappeared!!) I was hooked, even while reading this book in the middle of summer, I could feel the New England cold. This book is beautifully haunting, I’m obsessed.
The Red Tent describes the life of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, who appears in the biblical Book of Genesis. While her mention in the Bible only concerns her abduction by a Canaanite man and her brothers’ act of atrocity in response, The Red Tent tells the imagined life story of Dinah—including a childhood raised by several mothers, her first marriage, and life in Egypt, where she is a mother and midwife, finds love again, and overcomes tragedy.A biblically inspired, feminine focused book? A story that brings agency back to victimized women? That is right up my alley. And as expected, I loved this book! Especially the first two thirds of the book. The story gave shape to how I imagine the women mentioned in the Bible to be. Complex women, with their beauty, their faults, their way of loving, and grieving, losing and winning. I thought Dinah to be a very compassionate, loving narrator. The childlike wonder that she displayed in her world felt magical, in the way childhood feels magical. I absolutely loved getting to know the women who are only graced with their names in the Bible. Anita made everything feel so beautifully human. After such an romantic introduction to this story, I was not prepared for the whiplash that the murder of Dinah’s husband gave me. Nothing could have prepared me. I less enjoyed the parts Dinah spent in Egypt after having her son. Somehow that story line spoke less to me emotionally. That is not to say that that part had less emotional depth than the previous parts, I just could not connect. Anita did immediately rope me back in when Dinah started being a midwife. And then her love story with Benia, my God, that was everything and more. I cried unrelentless tears at Meryt’s death, it broke me. The end with Re’mose offering Dinah the most sincere sign of respect: “Re-mose married and told his wife about the mother who had sent him away so that he would not die but live.” Heartbreakingly beautiful. I’m sure I will always fondly remember this book.
“The Strangled Queen” is the second book in The Accursed Kings series. The book starts off right where the first one left it: right after the death of Philip the Fair. Now that the old king is dead, the new king, Louis X, has to fill the space his father left. Whereas Philip had a sternness that allowed him to stay in control of his Council, his son Louis is soon floundering between the powerful men who want to use him for their own personal gain. King Louis X finds himself in quite the predicament: his wife and Queen has been imprisoned and so he has no way of gaining legal heirs. The royal treasury is also at an all time low and the people cannot be taxed while they are already dying of starvation after bad harvests. Through delicate politics all the great names of the court and the financial world try to gain power while holding up the front of being loyal servants of King Louis. France under Louis will not be the same as it was under his father Philip. I absolutely adored the first novel of this series, so I couldn’t wait to start this second book. Unfortunately, this book did not grab my attention like the other did. When I read a historical novel, I want to be totally immersed into the time period. I struggled with that, because throughout the novel Druon reflected upon the Middle Ages from his own historical perspective of the 1950s. These reflections were entirely unnecessary and irrelevant in my opinion. Additionally, I found this book way more boring than the last. Neither book is packed with action, yet the political intrigue in this novel felt quite slow. There were no twists and turns I did not see coming pages before it happened. Nevertheless, the cliffhanger of the last chapters do make me wanna read the next installment of this series.Lastly, this specific type of historical novel is clearly not for everyone. Druon does not spend significant time on world building, and aesthetics. He gives the minimum of necessary description to place the story, but he does not indulge in describing the clothes worn, the art produced or the interior of the castles. Rather, a significant portion of the novel is spend on the building of the characters. Their characteristics, ideals and motivations are described in detail. I do have to say that this novel does not work as a stand alone novel: important characters introduced in the first book are not re-introduced. The novels seamlessly fit together, I assume it is best to read them in a quick succession.
With Europe’s drastically changing political landscape, spanning from the WWII up to the recent Covid epidemic, as the background, Roland Baines’ life has never felt entirely under his control. His helplessness as a young boy, all alone at boarding school, catches the attention of his piano teacher, Miriam Cornell. She is his first love, and the reason of so many scars in his life. 25 years later, when his wife abandons him with his infant son, those old scars start to bleed again. Roland has no choice by to look for answers in his family history. This was one of those reads for which my appreciation only grows over time. It is a heavy read, with many emotionally complicated topics. I needed time to see the bigger picture of this masterpiece. While reading, some parts bordered on boring, but boring in a way that feels extremely realistic, how a life can sometimes be stuck in a rut. At other moments, McEwan throws beautiful nuggets of wisdom about the human condition at you, and you can’t do anything but stare at a wall in silence. And I sure did some staring whenever it was revealed how much (childhood) trauma can haunt you for the rest of your life. I don’t think I’ve ever read a more thorough and empathetic look at what trauma does to a person, and everyone in that person’s life. From a broken mother/daughter relationship between Alissa and Jane, to Roland and his conflicting emotions about his piano teacher and how that links up with the trauma his mother went through during the war. Breathtakingly beautiful. There were many tears gathering behind eyes while reading, but the one moment I could not help but bawl, was (view spoiler)[when Roland seemingly finally had it all with Daphne and then she fucking died?!? (hide spoiler)] It was too much for my sensitive little heart. Additionally, there were many moments I wanted to scream at multiple characters (don’t get me fucking started on that asshole Peter), mostly I wanted to scream at that goddamn piano teacher. (view spoiler)[I wanted the confrontation between them to be some ultimate act of revenge, honouring the pain that she as an abuser caused. But his acceptance of her faults was more healing than revenge ever could be. (hide spoiler)] As Roland was finally putting all of those piece of himself together again, it felt like I could do the same. Once I’m fully recovered emotionally, I’m definitely going to jump into more of McEwan’s books.
It’s the perfect story to read to get the Christmas feeling. Although this story is heavy at times, Scrooge deserves it though, Dickens’ effortless humor shines through. I laughed and I cried, all to say I love this story.
Set 300 years before the events in A Song of Ice and Fire, FIRE AND BLOOD is the definitive history of the Targaryens in Westeros as told by Archmaester Gyldayn, and chronicles the conquest that united the Seven Kingdoms under Targaryen rule through to the Dance of the Dragons: the Targaryen civil war that nearly ended their dynasty forever.In this ASOIAF drought, while I’m still impatiently waiting for Winds of Winter, I decided to pick up one of the few ASOIAF books I hadn’t read yet. I haven’t seen the HBO show yet, so I went in blind. In some ways this book was better than I expected, in some ways it was worse. I loved the set up of the book, it being written like a ‘real’ history book that people in Westeros would read. Reminiscent of ‘real’ history books, some parts were kind of boring. And other parts were gripping, fast and exciting. The political background of the Dance of the Dragons was deliciously complex. Loved reading about that.Seeing that this is a history book, the characterization is very different from ‘normal’ fantasy books. Although, there are no internal thoughts, I did feel like I got to know the characters and their motivations. The breathtaking pictures throughout the book helped with filling in the gap that the used characterization leaves. It brings the characters closer. I absolutely adored Good Queen Alysane. And I was very impressed with the overall messages: the Targaryens started to believe in their own myth so much, that it caused them to become arrogant and careless and thereby creating their own doom. Thank God for the lineage page at the end of the book, because damn, could the Targaryens really not use more than 1 name for all their offspring? Ultimately, as always, I eat up anything and everything old Georgie-boy writes.
This infuriatingly bad book follows the story of Feyre. She lives in the human realm, close to the wall that separates it from the Faerie realm. Feyre has to hunt to sustain her dad and two (incompetent) sisters. On one of her hunting trips she kills a Fae wolf. In retribution she’s taking to the Spring Court where she meets the enchanting Tamlin. As a guest at Court she learns that the faerie realm has been subjected to an evil Queen who wants to destroy the human and Fae world alike. While figuring out her new surroundings, she meets a mysterious, alluring and dark Fae who appears to be the polar opposite of bright Tamlin. Feyre is convinced that she, a weak human, can fight this magical evil- in true Mary Sue fashion she manages to do so with minimal damage. Still can’t believe I read this book with my own two eyes - I hated every second of this. There is so much fundamentally wrong about this book, it’s overwhelming. First, the writing style is so unimaginative and repetitive. Why does everybody constantly drawl? Girl please, pick up a thesaurus. Luckily, drawling (talking) is not necessary to fall in love: one look at a weak, starving human female (yikes) and a powerful High Lord is instantly in love with her! This is such an unconvincing romance story, and not just because I hate the main characters. Tamlin has no charisma and is boring as a rock. Feyre cannot listen to any instruction given to her and she must delusional if she truly thinks that a weak girl (who hasn’t convinced me that she can actually hunt) has the ability to defeat Amarantha who has fought and won against so many strong fae? But hey, of course Feyre survives, because the level of threat is written so inconsistently. Amarantha is apparently unimaginably powerful but she can be defeated by a simple riddle with the answer love? Love! I hate it here: here being a fantasy world with disappointingly weak world building.I’ve never been more infuriated at a book before in my life. It was almost physically painful to get through. My anger goes so deep, I have a hate list: like why is SA so normalized? Its only saving grace is that it reads incredibly fast, the pain is only short lived. It is so bad, that I’m actually very intrigued about the sequels. I’m a hater at heart.
Patrick Bateman is the figure of success, he is a wealthy stockbroker in Manhattan, he is handsome, youthful, tanned, muscular, dressed to impress in all designer, and he has an attractive fiancée who he can take to the most prestigious restaurants in New York City. He is also a psychopathic, misogynistic killer who takes pleasure in torturing his victims to death in the most gruesome ways possible. It begs to question: how similar are the capitalistic pursuit of wealth and the psychotic pursuit of serial murder? From a first person perspective, Ellis takes you along in the brain of Bateman who as more time goes past seems to be losing more of his sanity. Buckle up, this book is a wild ride. This book was a trip, but I actually really enjoyed it. Don’t get me wrong, this book is disgusting and definitely not for the faint of heart. I seriously considered crying, screaming and throwing up at multiple chapters while reading. But the overall critique of capitalism and the unquestioned pursuit of wealth is absolutely brilliant. The relentless capitalist drive is definitely like the psychopathic drive for murder, it has no end but destruction. Ellis has such a thorough understanding of the Wall Street culture, he is able to transfer the essence of it to the reader, and while doing so he also takes the piss out of it in a ridiculous way. I loved how throughout the novel nobody every got Bateman’s name right – all of those man were too far up their own asses to see any daylight. Additionally, Bateman’s droning on about money, fashion and food is entirely disorienting, alienating and slightly boring so the brutal violence is massive wake-up call. Yet the violence is so casually mentioned between his endless thoughts on talk-shows that it makes you think you hallucinated it all. Bateman is batshit crazy, and he is iconic for it. This is one of the better contemporary books I have recently read, though I will still see any man who considers this their favourite book as a walking red flag. Certain topics in this book are just not for cis, straight men. Take for example the extreme misogyny, the way women are talked about by the male characters is horrendous but it is given a satirical spin while also still coming from really real place that is so easily identifiable for someone who has experienced misogyny. So although the surface is outwardly very homophobic, racist and misogynistic, this book truly is for the girls/gays/theys and Ellis is warning us to stay away from men (in finance). 100% recommend.
I can’t even write a review on this book without getting angry. I’m so sad I read this with my own two eyes. I cannot stand a story that solely exists on the premise that people cannot communicate. So naturally this book is NOT gonna be a favorite. Everybody in this book was a f*cking idiot!!! And don’t even get me started on the ending. I was already mad the first 200 pages, but the last 50 made me furious. There’s only one thing left to do, throw this piece of garbage in the trash where it belongs.
Daevabad has fallen. After Manizheh’s conquest Daevabad is left without magic, Nahri and Ali are stuck in Cairo and Dara is starting to realize that unwavering loyalty continues to cause the harm he is trying to avoid. He is forced to face his history in order to create a more positive future. Meanwhile, Nahri and Ali have their own struggles to face. They have to come in touch with the choices their ancestors made, and make better choices for the people they left behind in the grasp of a maniacal ruler. As a peaceful solution grows more difficult to grasp, and friends appear to be enemies, and enemies might actually be friends, they have no choice but to give it their all in the fight for a brighter future in Daevabad. Hate to say it, but the ending of this trilogy was kind of disappointing to me. I had such high hopes after the complexity of book 2, unfortunately this book was rather repetitive and not very innovative nor imaginative in its ending. The criticism I had for the previous book, also applies to this one: certain tropes were beaten to an absolute pulp. Dara’s realization arc could have been so good, but it wasn’t because almost every chapter he came to the same realization: Manizheh is bad. Yet he never used his realization to influence his actions, constantly hiding behind being an Asfhin that is supposed to be loyal to the Nahids. He had no problem disregarding Nahri’s wishes, so why not do the same to Manizheh??? At some point I had predicted that Dara would die, as ultimate penance for the destruction he caused. Such a sacrifice would have been so satisfying. And it would have allowed for Nahri to uphold her promise with the peris, which would finally put a stop to this endless cycle of revenge between the different species – ending this cycle of revenge which was the whole fucking point of saving Daevabad. It infuriated me that we got this weakass ending with Dara instead. As expected, I still hate Nahri: always so self-centred, and unable to appreciate any other perspective but her own. I truly did give her a fair shot, but she blew it the moment she complained about Jamshid’s personal hygiene after he had been locked up for weeks. GIRL GET A GRIP AND SHUT UP!Since Ali and Nahri were together for 95% of the book, I missed other perspectives to the struggle. I’d loved to see more about Muthandir’s revolt, or Zaynab’s survival during the siege. Anything with my fav priest Kartir, smartest person in Daevabad. So many more perspectives that could have been explored, but weren’t. Despite my qualms with this book, there are also enough good things about it. The writing style is great, the worldbuilding is beautiful. I still absolutely love that this fantasy is build upon Middle Eastern/Northern African mythology rather than the usual European. The attention paid to the details of clothing, architecture and rituals was fantastic. It just very much feels like a debut trilogy, with a little more experience Chakraborty has the potential to be an amazing writer.
As so many women before her, Nightbitch feels forced into her life as a stay-at-home-mom. Her identity as an artist is entirely replaced with her identity as a mother. And as a mother Nightbitch is exhausted and lonely with only her 2-year old son as company. When she feels like she is about to completely lose her mind, she finds patches of fur on her skin, an unusual hunger for raw meat, sharpening canines, new instincts and smells. She fears she is turning into a dog. This novel was weird, but in a good type of way. I loved that there was no introduction or long exposition, it just jumped right into the bizarre. And like any other novel about female rage this hits the spot for me. Rachel Yoder perfectly describes the feelings of loneliness, exhaustion and total despair that comes with motherhood and the loss of your identity as a non-mother. It is described in such a succinct yet colourful way, I could almost taste it. This book made me feel seen. Can’t speak from experience, but the relationship between Nightbitch and her husband felt infuriatingly realistic. If I ever meet this man in real life, I will hit him on sight. But, at some point it was annoying that the relationship did not seem to progress from the point we started – he is never confronted with how he basically ruined Nightbitch’s life. And because the book was entirely written from the Nightbitch’s perspective, it was impossible to understand the choices of any other character. The other moms’ characters felt entirely flat. Yes, they eventually come together as a group, but it did not feel like the emotional catharsis it could have been. To be honest, this short 200+ page book was way too long. I feel that this story would have worked better as a short story. The point was already clear in the first 50 pages, the rest was unnecessary and so repetitive. And with an allegory so brutal, it was kind of disappointing to have the message be spelled out in such detail. I wanted to love this so much, but I just can’t do it.
The tension built in the previous two book comes to a head in this explosive third book. Against all odds, Katniss has survived the Hunger Games twice. Now, instead of being at the mercy of the Gamemakers, Katniss is at the mercy of the rebels and their leader President Coin. District 12 is destroyed, Peeta is captured and the horrors that Katniss has seen are catching up to her. Though she has had no hand in making the military plans against the Capitol, Katniss is required to fill the most important role: being the face of the rebellion – The Mockingjay. Turns out, of all three books, I understood this one the least as a teenager. I remember this book being absolutely badass, with an ending I did not understand (view spoiler)[ (Katniss shooting Coin instead of Snow) (hide spoiler)]. Now I understand, and damn this book is bleak. As a teen I had entirely missed how President Coin, and in extension District 13, are just the newest iterations of President Snow and the Capitol. That realisation hit me hard. Additionally, I did not grasp the gravity of Finnick and Haymitch’s background stories, their histories are devastating. Before, everything we knew about the abuse the victors experienced pertained to Katniss personally, now I was emotionally invested in this war against Snow on behalf of everyone. I loved the character-driven writing of this novel, the added layers of characterization added so much emotional weight. You bet I cried myself to a headache over the bravest most underrated character of this trilogy: Cinna – I would die for him. (view spoiler)[ Again, did not care for the love triangle. And again, I dislike Gale so much. I understand that his perseverance, ruthlessness and fighting spirit are useful in a war, but those characteristics are not attractive in a life partner. Obviously, Katniss had to end with Peeta. Throughout the book any mention of: “the boy with the bread”, and I’m crying. Normally I hate when a badass female character is reduced to her ability to have children, but ending the book with Katniss feeling safe enough to have children? Absolute tears, I love it. The only thing I still do not understand about Katniss, is why did she vote in favour of the Hunger Games with Capitol children? It really does not fit with her characterization, Suzanne gives no explanation whatsoever. I can forgive and forget, especially with such a stellar ending. The fact that the Capitol and the Rebels alike used Katniss for their own means, and then just discarded this traumatized little girl who lost the one person she started this all for? Nah, jail time for everybody, and dare I say, including her mother. (hide spoiler)] Suzanne Collins you destroyed me body and soul, but I love you for it.
This novel is set in Jamaica, starting late thirties all the way up to the seventies, and it follows Gloria. Gloria (16 years) grew up in the countryside, but she was forced to flee after a traumatic experience. Together with her sister Marcia (14 years) she figures that Kingston can offer the opportunities she so much craves. She quickly finds out that opportunities for an uneducated black girl are sparse, especially in a time of political upheaval. This leads her to Sybil and Beryl, and their house of ill repute. It is there that Gloria meets Yang Pao, a Chinese man who’s life will forever be linked to hers. As Jamaica grows, changes and finds its own identity, Gloria too has to come to terms with her past, present and future. To my surprise, I absolutely loved this novel! Never read it because I really dislike the cover. Clearly, I should not have judged the book by it. Admittedly, this book is not ground-breaking by any means, it won’t get a Nobel prize. But personally, I connected to it like I’ve never done before. Gloria is by far my favourite book character of the year. I felt all the emotions reading this: I cried, I was angry, I was happy and giggling in love. This book gave me everything: social commentary, thoughts on the aftermath of slavery, the effect of sexual assault on a life, female emancipation, society’s response to homosexuality. And all of this through the lens of a sympathetic character you can’t help but root for. It was amazing, I will be rereading. Gloria is a perfectly written character, I have so much love for her. On paper, she is made to live in poverty: she is a black woman in a country that suffers from misogyny and racism/colourism. Yet she defies all odds, and carves out a piece of agency for herself – a freedom that is still formed by her identity as a black woman. As a character, Gloria is fully fleshed out, she has flaws, strengths, she grows and adjusts, and she has interesting responses to the society around her, that also reveals a lot about the history of Jamaica. To be honest, all characters are so perfectly contextualized, even when I wholeheartedly disagreed with Pao’s actions, it was clear that he did what he did because of his context. Everything is so intricately connected to everything like identity, time, and place, it makes everything feel so real. Other than Gloria and all other characters being so beautifully complex, the transportive language is what makes this book a masterpiece. I’ve never been to Jamaica, but I feel like I have. The way people speak and the descriptions of the city, clothes, colours and even smells sucked me in. On top of that, Kerry clearly has extensive knowledge of Jamaican history and politics. The subtle references to real life occurrences, like MLK visiting Jamaica give it such a grounded feeling. Additionally, Kerry has a great grasp of how identities and politics/social change intersect. Yes this is fiction, but it obviously does say loads about Jamaica. Most importantly, the love for Jamaica is felt throughout the novel, I have no choice but to love Jamaica too.
** spoiler alert ** Life can change in one split second, the life of infamous bachelor Michael Stirling was never the same after laying his eyes on Francesca Bridgerton. Michael who has known many women, knows that she is the only one for him. Unfortunately, she is happily married to his cousin John. Francesca Bridgerton’s life changed forever when that same John died not only two years into their marriage. She never would have pictured herself as a widow at only 22. Grief tears Francesca and Michael apart, but maybe the love they both have for John can bring them together too. After the dumpster fire that is Eloise’s story, this book was honestly such a reprieve. The reading experience was 100 times better. I very much enjoyed the way this book just immediately jumped into trauma. No long introduction, just instant pain – I’m with it. For the first three quarters of the book I was so surprised with Michael’s emotional intelligence, he honestly seemed like a properly nice man. How he saved Francesca from assault, and made sure that she knew it wasn’t her fault, I adore it. My only complaint was that Michael is such a goofy name, but I still like him. But then, like any other Bridgerton man, he has to (emotionally) manipulate a woman into marriage. What the fuck is up with that, Julia? Why does Michael have a breeding kink? No thank you… Manipulation is never romantic nor sexy, it’s just CREEPY. Speaking about ‘breeding’, I loved the infertility plot at the end, and how Francesca seemed to find her peace with it. It was almost disappointing that she did end up having children, her story would have been more special if she stayed childless, especially in a family where having tons of kids is the norm.This book is pretty mid: great at some points, awful at others. The biggest highlight for me was how fun the family dynamics were written. For a family of 8 children, I feel like none of the other books really depict how it is to have siblings. The conversations between Hyacinth and Francesca were so realistic, I felt like I was there. And of course, my love Violet was just being the amazing mother that she is. I want more sibling banter, less sleazy man manipulating themselves into the beds of vulnerable women, please and thank you.
This was a tough read, I’m surprised my eyeballs survived all of the eye rolling I did. There so many things wrong with this book. Firstly, these characters are all assholes – literally every single one of them is so unlikeable. And not in a “I love to hate them” type of way, but in a “if these people were real I would avoid them like the plague” type of way. Also their reactions to intense situations don’t make sense – why were they so nonchalant about being shot at during some weird hazing ritual? The dialogues they have are so annoying: they constantly talk like they’re philosophizing in a cringey Tumblr way. And their obsession with sex? So juvenile and irrelevant. Even the one character I was neutral about, did a full 180 at the end. Bad characters are a mortal sin for a book that is entirely character driven. Secondly, there is no plot whatsoever, and the magical world is a hot mess. Nothing made sense. The thing that annoyed me most is how the magical people distinguished themselves from non-magical people by calling them ‘mortal’… The magical people could also die??? They are not immortal??? So why use mortality as a distinguishing feature??? Additionally, it was not clear at all how the magical world related to the ‘normal’ world. Somehow magic is hidden, but also the CIA, MI6 and private corporations not only know about magic but want to harness it for themselves? Nothing was explained, which is another mortal sin: the world building was entirely lacking. The only thing I know for sure is that Blake confirmed that Jesus is a magic man. Thirdly, the pacing and set up of this novel is just atrocious. Every chapter is told from the perspective of one character, which creates massive holes in the timeline of the story – too many things happen when you’re not there as the reader. It is entirely too much tell, not enough show. This also makes the characters so one dimensional, until the end of the book there are hardly any group interactions. Lastly, I hate it when a book tries to go deep just for the sake of being deep. Throughout the novel, Blake creates this seemingly smart remarks about power , but these remarks are not explored at all. Truly, just saying something smart, does not make you smart – show us how you’re smart, don’t tell us. Everybody who said this is a good book is a filthy liar, this book is bad. Not terrible, but bad. This book is as much Dark Academia fantasy, as a kitten is a lion: there is just a whisper of the genre's elements. It took 300 pages before the story gets slightly interesting, and then the ending was very predictable. I put in so much labour for no reward. But I love pain, so I will read the sequel.
As a grown man safe in the US, Amir looks back to his childhood in Afghanistan. His childhood was primarily formed by two things. One, his unequal yet fundamental friendship with Hassan, the son of the house servant. And two, his unwavering need for his baba’s approval. Even before the Russians invaded Afghanistan, Amir’s life had changed forever. On the day that should have been the best day of his life, Amir witnesses something so horrific and traumatizing it forever changes his outlook on everything. Unable to deal with the horror he has just witnessed, Amir sets in motion a set of choices he will regret for the rest of his life. 26 years later Amir has the opportunity to fix the choices he made all those years ago – will he find the forgiveness he desperately craves?This book not only tells the tragic story of two childhood friends, it also gives a glimpse into the devastation Afghanistan has been through since the overthrowing of its last king. It will come as no surprise that this book had me bawling like a baby. Especially the death of Baba had me blubbering, it gave me a massive headache. At some point I could not pick up this book without getting teary eyed. As with ‘A Thousand Splendid Suns’, Hosseini masterfully paints a colourful picture of a country many people only associate with war. He brings Afghanistan to life in a way no one else can. Even when he’s just giving historical background to the conflict in Afghanistan, he manages to do so with a powerful emotional punch. Yet despite the heavy topics, everything is surprisingly easy to read. Hosseini is still one of my favourite contemporary writers.I have read this book before as a teenager, back then I only understood the surface level. Now I finally feel like I understood all layers of e.g. the relationship between Amir and Hassan. The story is tragic and beautiful with a very hopeful ending, but I have a few issues with how the tragedy was handled. At some point the amount of tragedies thrown at me were too much. As a reader I had hardly any time to digest one trauma before another came up. I also felt like the tragedies almost worked as a distraction to how I honestly felt about what happened between Amir and Hassan – I felt emotionally manipulated into having sympathy for Amir. Thinking about it, Amir is the true antagonist, who hides behind his perceived lack of parental attention from his dad. What he did is truly vile, and I cannot, should not, feel that bad for him. His guilt and need for punishment should not trump the trauma he caused Hassan and his son. That is kind of iffy, other than that I loved this novel.
After finishing this book, I’m absolutely speechless. I’ve never read a book like this before, but if I have to compare it to something else, I’d say that the book reads like an ethnography I used to read for school. The novel chronicles the life story of the scientist Dr. Abraham Norton Perina, edited and published by his friend Dr. Ronald Kubodera. After an unconventional childhood, and an unusual rise in the scientific world, Perina gets the opportunity to observe a lost tribe on the island of Ivu’ivu. There he makes an world-changing discovery, the people on Ivu’ivu are able to greatly surpass their natural lifespan. After returning to the United States, Perina achieves great scientific succes and fame with his discovery. As great as the success, as great is also the cost not only to Perina but also to the island of Ivu’ivu. This book tackles topics such as: cultural collision, scientific responsibility and morality - what happens when two unequal powers meet and influence each other? Initially, I was hesitant to read this book. Yanagihara is increasingly seen as a controversial author who does not shy away from difficult topics. From the very start this book made me feel uncomfortable. The evocative language, and beautiful descriptions took this feeling away. The moment I thoroughly enjoyed the read, the descriptions of the rituals Perina witnessed brought the feelings of uncomfortableness right back. In other words, this book keeps you on your toes, I always had to know what happens next. I can’t say that the end of the book came as a surprise, I felt it coming pages before, but it was still shocking and absolutely revolting. Without this ending and how it was introduced, the book wouldn’t be as good as it is. The commentary this book provides on cultural/moral relativism, the clashes between cultures perceived as unequal and the personal subjectivity of “objective” science is interesting and important. We should remember that science is conducted by subjective people, and that their interactions with the world around them is never free of consequences. While the islands of Ivu’ivu and U’ivu are fictional, their described destruction is absolutely real to many nations across the world.
It is no secret that I loathe ‘The Atlas Six’, and ‘The Atlas Paradox’ is no better – it was so BORING. Almost 400 pages and what for? Confusing plot, lacklustre worldbuilding, disappointing characterization and way too many filler chapters about their supposed research. Gun to my head, don’t ask me what the plot was about, the moment I turned a page, everything I read immediately left my brain. What I do remember, is that yet again this story forces you to read about convoluted theories that don’t matter. Forcing me to read about Jung? Jail, immediately.Secondly, the characterization is still bad. I had such high hopes for Libby’s villain arc. They did her so dirty last book, girl had all the right to snap into being evil. Sadly, Libby gave nothing. She was just a dick who thought she was justified, maybe Belen will get the villain arc Libby could’ve had. I wished she would just lean in, no excuses, full throttle. But no, in her head she’s still the innocent little girl, who cannot do any wrong. Another character destroyed: Reina – Olivie gave her personality and I instantly hated her. So insufferable with her whole God complex thing. Girlie, take a chill pill you’re not all that. And also: HOW DOES THAT WORK? Like do the gods really exist? Is Jesus a magic man? And ‘mortals’ don’t know about it so they worship him? Explain Olivie, your magic world makes no sense. Thirdly, the biggest ick of this book: the casualness about actual murder? Y’all are psychopaths who don’t see anyone as complete people, with loved ones. Who just thinks about KILLING someone when they piss you off? And what for? The Society? It is not even clear what they do, so I don’t get the stakes?The plot about them potentially losing their power, was intriguing the first time it was mentioned, I lost interest after the 10th time. And in the end, there was no real satisfaction with the answer. Again, it felt so draining to have read so many pages without having all plot points satisfactorily explained. All of this for… nothing? :/ I’m going to read the last book, but I deserve financial compensation and/or my therapy paid for.
In 1945, shortly after the end of WWII, happily married couple Claire and Frank decide to go on a trip to the Scottish Highlands to finally spent quality time together after being apart for 6 years. This reunion trip does not go according to plan. While exploring the Highlands, they stumble across standing stones where women of the nearby village perform a ritualistic dance. It is at those stones that Claire is magically transported roughly 200 years back in time. She finds herself in the midst of a Scottish skirmish against the oppressing English, and so she is taking into the heart of the Scottish Highlands. Claire has to do everything in her power to blend in and stay alive in this unfamiliar time with apprehensive people, while also dealing with the repercussions that come with time travel. Soon enough Claire is so intertwined with these 18th century people – can she still return to her own time? This is a story about love, loss, strength, political manoeuvring and the stubbornness of Scottish Highlanders. This is one of those books that I’ve been wanting to read for forever, but never did because starting such a long series is always slightly daunting. I’m glad I finally made the jump. Though I already knew what would happen, I have watched the show previously, this book had me hooked from the very first page – it was as if I had never heard the story before. The writing style is incredibly compelling, the language is personable and easy to understand. The characterization of all major characters is done brilliantly, within the first few chapters I already had the feeling that I understood Claire, and her actions, thoughts and motives. Normally I don’t particularly enjoy first-person stories, but here I absolutely did not mind because Claire is such an attractive/charming character to identify with. Most importantly, Diana has a wonderful way of subverting the well-known “damsel in distress” tropes. Everything about what happens to Claire is incredibly distressing, yet she is a woman who knows her power, and she works it so that she can get the things she wants. The stereotypical strong man, Jamie, is the one who needs to be saved, when they meet. While the strength of the characters is emphasized frequently, the characters are also beautifully flawed, like all of us are. The characters are raw and real (and horny). I love all of them, Jamie especially. This is not a book you read when you want something ground-breaking, with grand philosophical passages – this is something you read when you want easy and quick entertainment with a slight edge. So when reviewing this book for what it is, I have to say it is absolutely amazing. I loved every second of it, I couldn’t put it down. I was fully emotionally invested in everything that happened, I screamed, I cried, I laughed. I’m so excited to read the next instalment of this series. Diana has got my mind, body and soul.
The main story of this novel straightforward, the married couple Amelia and Adam are in a very rough patch in their marriage. As a last ditch effort, they decide to go on a romantic weekend away in the Scottish Highlands. The atmosphere in the converted chapel they’re staying in, immediately turns their romantic getaway in an eerie one. On top of that, the secrets they’ve kept from each other are threatening to destroy their relationship for once and for all. Nothing is what it seems.This was an incredible thriller, exactly what I wanted! This book kept my on my toes the entire timing, the plot kept me gasping till the very last page. Firstly, it was very refreshing to read a book about “older” characters, I’ve grown very tired of the usual teenagers or 20-somethings that are the main characters. Secondly, Feeney is an incredibly clever writer. I love when a book contains the reason for why the book had to be written in the first place, and this is one of them. The entire plot perfectly fits within itself. Additionally, throughout the book Feeney seems to be giving you hints about the big twist. Every time I thought I had it figured out, the initial hint is entirely refuted and you have to start again at square one. This keeps you intrigued throughout the novel.Throughout the novel, details are incredibly important. Certain things mentioned offhandedly in the earlier chapters, might become extremely important in the later chapters. With that being said, you shouldn’t look into all the details too much - take them for what they are. For example, in reality Adam’s face blindness won’t cause him to completely not remember anyone at all. You gotta suspend some of your belief. All in all, I absolutely loved this book. I honestly did not see the ending coming at all. Definitely worth 5 stars.
This chilling second book of The Poppy War trilogy, picks up immediately after the destruction of Mugen in the first book. Nikara may have defeated their shared enemy the Federation during the third Poppy War, but now the empire is more splintered than ever. Rin simultaneously has to deal with her role in the war and its consequences and, learn how to take command of the Cike. More than anything Rin wants to kill the Empress Daji for condemning Altan to die. To do so she is forced to ally with the Dragon Warlord who has his own plans. Tensions are rising, people are starving and a civil war is waiting to explode.I am speechless. Kuang has me by the throat. This book is magnificent. I was a little nervous starting this book, seeing how The Poppy War ended on such a high note – the high note kept on giving for the entire book. The mixed feelings I already had about Rin got only more complicated. On the one hand I want her to be safe, and be happy, then she inevitably makes such stupid and/or annoying decisions that I’m almost praying for her downfall. Her selfishness, inability to apologize and refusal to see her own faults drove me up the wall. However Kuang’s understanding and usage of PTSD/anxiety/addiction is so compelling that I empathize with Rin again. Everything is an emotional rollercoaster. Additionally, all the relationships among the main characters are intriguing: I love how Kitay, Nezha, Venka, and Rin find each other in their memories of Sinegard, but then also hurt each other over their acquired trauma’s. Kuang is a master in writing characters.This book is, in my opinion, even darker than the previous one. Again, the war is explicitly described, with awful acts of violence. What makes it really dark, are the themes of racism and colonialism. it gets increasingly worse the further along I read. At first it was refreshing to read about foolish “Europeans” from an Eastern perspective, rather than reading about ‘exotic’ Easterners from an European perspective. The freshness quickly faded when the Europeans became the most disgusting, racist pieces of shit to ever exist (very on brand). I do have to admit, that this added an interesting new dimension to the novel, war is not an isolated occurrence. More than that, it added to Kuang’s point of: a war is not done when the fighting has finished; it is ongoing until the political structure is established. I cannot fathom how this story is going to end in an remotely positive way, but I can’t wait to find out in the last novel.(view spoiler)[p.s. I will never stop crying about little Ramsa’s death; he is a true hero (hide spoiler)]
Miri and Leah have been married for several years. Marine biologist Leah is often gone on deep sea expeditions. On her last mission, for the mysterious organization known as the Centre, Leah leaves for an expected three-week exploration and does not return for another six months. Miri anxiously awaits her wife’s return. Eventually, Leah comes home, Miri must take care of her. But Leah has changed. She is uncommunicative and distant, spending most of her time in the bath. She eats little, begins to drink saltwater, and slowly transforms into something visibly less human. Meanwhile, Miri reminisces about their past together; remembers her deceased (and difficult) mother, whom Leah never met; and attempts to reconcile her love for Leah with a growing imperative to let her go.I don’t know what I expected when buying this book, but this was not it. I was most pleasantly surprised. This little book is hauntingly beautiful. The thing I remember most about it, is the language used. The language resembles the feeling of being dragged under to the depths because of the weight of grief felt over losing someone you love. It is about the ocean, and feels like the ocean – unrelentless, dark and deep, but also beautiful and romantic. It’s a horror that touches upon the fear of monsters lurking in the darkness, but it is mainly about the horror of loving and losing. I love a horror that does not rely on gore or shock value. But it was most certainly scary at points. Miri having to watch Leah literally disintegrate in front of her eyes, beautiful analogy for grief, but goddamn that’s some scary stuff. And I already had a deep grounded fear of the open ocean, it is so much worse now. I am lucky enough to not have lost someone close to me, I have not gone through the type of grief Miri felt losing her mother, and losing Leah. Yet, grief is something that feels like part of my life without having experienced it as much. Armfield has clearly done extensive research into human psychology. The plot about people cosplaying grief was very interesting, and thought provoking. How grief is something to be hidden, and only shared with those that go through the exact same thing as you do. It almost felt like a cry to humanity: don’t suffer in silence. As always, I’m sure many details and subtle commentary went straight over my head. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this crazy little book.
What an incredible book. I’m almost speechless because of how much I loved it. The outer layer of the story appears to be about the rise of a young star in Hollywood, but the personal implications of that rise hit so deep. Of course, being a rich and famous movie star is not relatable for most women, but the way Evelyn as a woman was viewed by the public was so recognizable. Evelyn’s struggle with the difference between her outward perceived sexuality, and her innermost sexual desires hit me hard. How the male gaze influenced her life was described in such a beautiful way, it was as if I had just been objectified by my (nonexistent) husband. The language used throughout the book perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the scenes described. Even while being an European reader, I was fully immersed into the American glitz and glam. Most importantly, the emotional weight of it palpable in every page. I felt all the love, and the pain of having to hide who you are. The language also perfectly captured Evelyn. Evelyn is such a complex woman, but I understood her perspective. I definitely did not agree, but I do admire her for the choices she made.I don’t cry often over books, but this book had me sobbing at the end of it. The love story between Evelyn and Celia is all I could have ever hoped for. Their love was beautiful, strong but also realistically complex. It really brought close the struggle LGBTQ+ people must have gone through before homosexuality was even remotely accepted. It made me grateful for living in the time that I do, but it also made me aware that the fight is far from over. No one should have to go through so many impossible hoops to be with someone they love. I do have to admit that I did not particularly care for Monique’s storyline. Although the reveal did have me shocked, that extra layer was not necessary for me. Even without it, it would have made sense that Evelyn would pick someone so aware of what she was planning to do. But this little note does not weigh up against the sheer brilliance of this book. It most definitely deserves all 5 stars.
Everyone knew Sophie was a bastard, including her – she has spent her life on the edges of society as a servant. So when she has the chance to spend a magical night at a masquerade ball, she takes it wholeheartedly. For one night, she can be who she wants and spend it twirling in the arms of her ‘Prince Charming’: Benedict Bridgerton. But the clock always strikes midnight, and the magic ends. But neither Benedict nor Sophie can forget that night and what it meant to them. Will they have a chance at happily ever after despite their class differences?‘An offer from a gentleman’? Where? Which gentleman? Julia Quinn surely can’t mean that crust-lord, manipulative, dismissive asshole Benedict Bridgerton. Good grief, I want to scream at that man. Every choice he made was the wrong one, and still he got the girl? This was not a romance book, it was the complete opposite, it was a ‘how do I manipulate myself a wife’ handbook. And I had such good hope, because I actually liked the previous Bridgerton book. Sadly, I wasn’t feeling it from the very beginning, the Cinderella plot was not giving at all. Please, change it up more than just switching the shoe for a glove. It gave Sophie’s background such a weird cartoon-y vibe. Araminta especially felt like a caricature cartoon villain, and I couldn’t care less about it all. I did care about the fact that Sophie is basically just a victim, manipulated into this marriage with a man who never fully listened to her, nor understood her. I will scream it from the rooftops: Benedict Bridgerton is the worst Bridgerton (so far). He started out so well, saving Sophie from sexual assault, love that. From there on out, it only went downhill. Fast. Because why was this man’s first urge after getting her alone in his house to GRAB HER AND HAVE HIS WICKED WAY WITH HER??? What the actual fuck? Of course he felt so sanctimonious after resisting that urge. And then he had the nerve to completely lose his shit after she refused to be his mistress, because how could a lowly servant ever deny a handsome Bridgerton man what he wants. Sophie had to literally fight him off, wow yeah, so romantic. And still, he managed to coerce her exactly in the way he wanted, by threatening to have her falsely arrested or have her reputation ruined by sexually assaulting her in public. He was fully making use of that power imbalance. Why was there no comeuppance for this behaviour? None of his behaviour was even remotely okay. And after all of that he still had the nerve to demand an apology from HER after finding out her true identity??? I am infuriated! This book is awful.
This coming-of-age story set in 19th century France, recounts the life story of Le Grande Meaulnes in relation to timid, but loyal François. Their early school days together were typical for any boy at that time. This changed when Meaulnes accidentally came upon a mystical estate. There during a confusing yet wonderful engagement party, he meets the enchanting Yvonne. For years after, he tries to find her, the estate and all the positive feelings associated with it again. Although eventually successful in finding her, the reality can never live up to the glorified nostalgia. Meaulnes is left unhappy and wandering. Eventually, François discovers what truly went down, and his life will never be the same for it. To me, there is something inherently nostalgic, whimsical and sad about 19th century French literature. My heart could not take the added tragedy of the actual story. The progression of emotion from hopeful, eager-eyed teenaged boys, to grown men beaten by their own choices and unfortunate circumstances, was so seamlessly integrated into the story. The character development of both Francois and Meaulnes gave me everything I needed and more. I do have to admit, I have a massive soft spot for Francois, yet at the end of the book when all is out in the open, I feel for both of them. Realizing that nostalgia can only be chased, but never caught is a hard realization to come to. And owning up to your mistakes is even harder. Despite the realism of emotion in this book, the story always felt slightly whimsical. Of course, the party Meaulnes changed upon was meant to be whimsical, but this feeling stayed throughout the novel. As a coming-of-age story, this book really reminds of “The Catcher in the Rye”. Both novels perfectly articulate the joy but also fears, the marvel, the feeling of freedom and opportunity that comes with becoming an adult, and having to face one’s own choices and responsibilities. That part of life is whimsical and magical and scary. As an adult ps teenage years, I felt that magic again for a moment, because of that I rate this book 4 stars.
At the end of Time of Contempt, things are bad. The mages’ conclave is torn apart by treachery, to great devastation. Geralt is almost killed trying to protect Ciri. The Witcher has been separated from his destiny. Delivered to the dryads of Brokilon more dead than alive, he craves information about what happened to Ciri. When he hears that the emperor of Nilfgaard has her and is planning on marrying her, Geralt is determined to save her. With a new band of helpers, he begins his journey to save Ciri, but does she even want to be saved by him? Ciri herself is teleported to a faraway desert before being accepted into a local gang. And Yennifer is just plain gone, no one can find her.Another great book, you can feel the plots converging towards each other for the explosion of a life time. I loved the storytelling structure of ‘it’s a long story’, it is very engaging. It’s got me hyped. I live for Ciri in her villain era, my girl is traumatised as hell, she has no one to rely on but herself and her skills, and what are her skills: killing to survive, like a true Witcher. My heart breaks for her, and I can’t wait to obviously see her get her happy ending. Similarly, I love Geralt’s friendship era. Him just trekking around the countryside with his family of weirdos. I adore Regis, he is so weird but adorable. Again, Sapkowski brilliantly foreshadows that something is off about him, but you don’t know what exactly. Once you find out, all the previous puzzle pieces satisfyingly just fall into place. Additionally, the parallel between his blood thirst and addiction (alcoholism) was done beautifully. I adore this way of writing. Of course I love Dandelion being his obnoxious self, I adore Milva being the badass queen she is. And then there is Cahir… I don’t know about him yet. I kind of like him, but also what is he doing? I’m so curious about him. The one storyline I do not really care for, is the plot of the sorceresses. I love a good girlboss moment (when they called men too emotional to rule, yeah I felt that), but I’m not invested enough in their characters to care about what they are doing. Though they did help me to finally understand Ciri’s ancestry – that had me screaming. I just miss Yennefer, girly where are you? I need yo! I really hope she’s going to pop up next book with a masterful plan that ensures that everybody is going to have a happily ever after. A girl can dream and be delusional :).
I was so excited to read this book when I bought it, already 100 pages in I felt disappointment coming and now after finishing it I’m just sad. I’m mainly sad because I did not like Nella as narrator. She obviously struggles with her black identity, she was known as the “Oreo” in high school, and she only started discovering her natural hair as an adult. The way Nella thinks/feels throughout the book about it almost makes it sound like she sees herself as an underprivileged victim, despite that she clearly has an educated, middle class background. In relation to Hazel, this makes her seem jealous rather than stuck in an orchestrated scheme. Of course, Hazel is the “bad guy” of the story, but I feel like her characterization could have been made more obvious, so that she would’ve stood out more as a *different type* of black womanThis book is supposed to be a thriller, and to be totally honest only the last 50 pages or so made me feel some suspense. The suspense didn’t last though, the epilogue just left me confused…? What did it all mean, and what are we supposed to take away from this story? The rest of the book was so incredibly slow, it’s almost not worth reading for such a weird plot.
The kings and armies are manoeuvring for position, each fearing invasion from across the river, each fearing their neighbours more. Intrigue, dissent and rebellion fester on all sides. After decades of oppression, the elves and other races are fighting each other and attacking the humans - and with growing numbers preparing for battle, the threat of all-out war looms ever greater. Against this backdrop of fear, Geralt and Yennefer must protect Ciri, the orphaned heir who is sought by all sides. For the child of prophecy has the power to change the world - if she lives to use it.Lemme start with a little self-roast, I had a hard time understanding this book, because for half of it I did not understand what contempt meant. I kid myself into thinking I’m as close as possible to being a native speaker, no girl, you’re not, you need a dictionary. All the political manoeuvring went straight over my head. I was still vibing though. Other than that, I still think this book was a little difficult to understand. Again, I really need a map! The entire Isle of Thanedd plot??? Huh, I had questions marks all over my face the entire time. Who was on which side fighting for what?? Same with the difficult story of Ciri’s heritage. It took a lot of rereading certain passages, and googling loads to fully understand it. Again, shout-out to the fandom wiki. I loved the dessert plot, of Ciri having to find herself when she feels utterly abandoned by those she thought would protect and love her forever. Absolutely heartbreaking, but my girl is a fighter. It was a perfect segue into her villain era: her losing her power because of the fire she used to save Little Horse who then leaves her???. And then her accidentally taking up the name of her fiery ancestor Falka?!? Sapkowsksi was using his big brain connecting all the puzzle pieces he’s been feeding us. I’m living for it! The one thing I hated with a passion: the sexual assault scene. Sexual assault should not be used as a plot device to get a character to wise up, or harden. It is just gross, and it did ruin the book for me. This is my least favourite instalment so far.
This one of a kind novel follows the adventure of Zachary Ezra Rawlins. After finding a book in which his own history is described in great detail, he finds himself within a larger-than-life mystery that leads him from place to place. After attending magical masquerade parties, ominous secret clubs and Zachary eventually travels to an underground world filled with cats, books, candles and even more mysteries. When this underground world, known as the Harbor, appears to be falling apart, Zachary will stop at nothing to safe this world and the story of which he himself is an integral part. I don’t even know how to start reviewing a book that is so magnificent, brilliant and overwhelming such as this one. I heard someone describe this book as: “not driven by a comprehensible plot, but just pure immaculate vibes”, and I have to agree. This is not a book that you read to understand the plot, this book is one that you read to forget about your own regular life. And damn, the vibes are amazing! I was definitely transported to a whole new world like Zachary was. I also heard people say that they disliked Zachary as the protagonist because he seems like an “empty character.” And yes, maybe Zachary isn’t the most fleshed out character ever. But by leaving him as a blank slate, as a reader you can easily identify yourself with him, and feel like you are the one on this amazing adventure. Morgenstern is an amazingly talented writer, she uses language and imagery like no other. It is relatively easy to read, and get into, and then it just explodes into this mystical, magical and magnificent story. Plotwise, I have to admit that I still don’t really understand what happened. Who is the Owl King? who is Mirabel? And what happens to Zachary and Dorian at the end of the story? Honestly, I don’t care. Morgenstern gives the reader ample opportunity and space to give their own meaning and significance to the story. In my opinion, this makes the story so much better, there is no overarching narrative to tell you what to think, or what to feel - it is all up to you. This is definitely one of the my most favorite books of all time. I can’t wait to reread it again, to re-experience the magic and maybe find some more hidden treasures I missed reading it the first time.
Years before Katniss participation in the 74th Hunger Games, there was the 10th annual Hunger Games. As usual, the games are a matter of life and death, but this time it isn’t only so for the tributes, but also for Coriolanus Snow. Despite the reputation his name holds, the Snow family is crumbling. As mentor of the girl of district 12, Coriolanus has to win to safe his reputation. Their fates are now inextricably intertwined. And he has to be willing to do anything to survive, anything to win, because Snow has to land on top. I’m going to be honest, this book is not nearly as good as the initial trilogy. Nothing tops the initial trilogy. Nevertheless, I did enjoy gaining more insight into the fucked up world of Panem and the Capitol specifically. This book is split up in roughly three parts, before the games, during the games and after the games. I enjoyed the during, not so much the before and after. Suzanne Collins is brilliant in writing the inherent tragedy of the games, of having literal children fight for the change to survive and be left with all this inexplicable trauma. Every time I think we’ve reached the depth of despair, Collins opens up a whole new layer of pain. And I love to get hurt. This entire book is written from the perspective of Coriolanus Snow. And my god, he is so incredibly self-centred, it’s mind boggling. In all honestly, I did not enjoy being in his head the entire time. For me, the characters surrounding him made the book what it was. I loved Tigris, Sejanus, and Lucy Gray. I even have a special place in my heart for Dean Highbottom. Fuck Dr. Gaul though, that is one of the scariest motherfuckers ever. Being in Snow’s head did give me more appreciation for his actions in the original trilogy. His ‘love story’ with Lucy Gray, illustrates how strange Katniss loyalty to Peeta must have been to him, because if it were him he would never have placed someone else’s life above his own like Katniss does. All to say, this is a great book for further understanding but definitely not a necessary read.
This book is the brilliant end to a brilliant trilogy – it gave me everything I wanted and more. After being betrayed by her latest allies, Rin only has her anger left to try and win the war and dispel the Hesperians from her country. First, she has to go find an army. She decides to go South, to the provinces most disregarded by leadership in the North. In the faces of the Southerners, the anger Rin has held on to is reflected back to her. She is there last hope, their hero, their God. But as recent history has taught, Gods are without plan, merciless – and the Phoenix most of all wants to destroy. Can Rin both save her country and keep the Phoenix in check?I think that this series is now officially the best thing I have read so far this year. The ending beautifully wraps up everything Kuang put forward in the previous two books, without giving it a “and they lived happily ever after” ending. I would not have loved it as much if it were less ambiguous. A story about a morally grey character like Rin feels complete with neither a hopeful nor a hopeless ending – it could not have ended in any other way. Admittedly, midway through the novel I started to get slightly bothered by the choices Rin made, nothing she did could have led to a peaceful ending. Looking back, seeds for the inevitable ending were already being planted, which makes the ending even more brilliant. Not to toot my own horn, but while reading the second book I had written in my notes: “If Rin and Nezha don’t either kiss or kill each other, I’m going to scream” (IYKYK). For all the (emotional) hoops the characters have been through, no other end would have made sense. I especially loved the concept that history is cyclical, an idea (I believe) already introduced in the first book, that then turns out to be of utmost importance in this book. This might well be one of the most intelligently put together series I’ve ever come across. While this trilogy is clearly fantasy, I’m still so impressed with how grounded everything felt in reality. Kuang has relevant and important takes about war and its consequences, both physical and mental; and about colonialism and the effect of a evolutionary take on racism can have on native people. Starting out, I would have never guessed that a fantasy novel would make me think this much about the real world. Throughout the novels it is made abundantly clear that colonialism is an evil ideology, so it is slightly disappointing that the final conclusion leads to “we can’t survive without the colonialists’ help”. This almost justifies the violence they have committed. Though, on the other hand, in the context of this specific story, no other conclusion could have been reached. Overall, this was a ingenious novel and series, it is going to be nigh impossible to find anything that comes close to this excellence – I’m griecing the fact that I can never experience this again for the very first time. Now I can’t wait for Babel by R. F. Kuang to be officially released. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend The Poppy War trilogy.
Another stellar novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Primarily set in the 70ies, this novel paints a vivid and convincing picture of the Rock ‘n Roll lifestyle in California: booze, drugs, fame, sex, heartbreak, etc. Daisy Jones is the epitome of that lifestyle: she’s a free spirit with an overwhelming amount of charisma, raw power, and pain. She appears to have it all, and is set to become a famous singer. Parallel to Daisy, the band The Six also rise to fame. The Six too fully embody the wild lifestyle of that era, nothing is out of bounds. Separately, Daisy and The Six are good, but together they’re phenomenal. But what happens when a group of volatile, damaged, magnificent people come together in a world where all your worst vices are encouraged - they discover that not all that glitters is gold. And they will tell you about it in a in-depth interview. Previously I read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I absolutely loved it. So naturally my expectations were incredibly high for this book: all my expectations were met and more. Again I was hooked before the end of the first page. Evelyn and Daisy’s stories are like a continuation of each other: both women are dealt a difficult hand, still they manage to get what they want in a deceptive world. Jenkins Reid writing style is incredibly convincing, it immediately transported me to a place and time I’ve never been. At the same time, the language is familiar, and so easy to understand. Even when writing an entire book in the form of a transcript, which is arguably a distant form of writing, I had no trouble imagining the places and atmospheres described. Additionally, the pacing of the story was very pleasant and exciting. The slower place, had longer chapters with more points of views, while the fast pace had shorter chapters with less points of views. This kept the story fluid, and engaging. There was also a fair bit of foreshadowing, which kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to find out what happens next asap. Even though you only meet the characters through the descriptions by others in their interviews, all characters are fully formed. Maybe even more so, because of the interview format. Characters are able to conflicting perspectives to the same occurrence, which made me fully appreciate that one story has endless sides to it. Though the story is clearly centered around Daisy and Billy, the other characters’ stories give a rich atmosphere to the reality of a rockstar in the 70ies. I found myself emotionally invested in all characters. Though their lives are far from relatable, I found myself identifying with so many core aspects to their personalities. This book moved, I have nothing but good to say about it. I highly recommend it.
Oliver has just served 10 years for a murder he may not have committed. After 10 years the head detective wishes nothing more than to finally definitively know what happened that night. In a series of conversations, Oliver finally reveals all the details of his time at an elite conservatory for Shakespearean theatre. And how the drama of the play him and his friends were rehearsing, slowly seeped into reality, with deadly consequences as result. This book gives off ‘theatre kids’ vibes, and I don’t like theatre kids… This book reads like a weak and cringey rip off of ‘The Secret History’. I loved that book, so honestly this book didn’t stand a fucking chance. All 7 of the main characters were infuriating to me. The constant referencing of Shakespeare quotes was funny enough the first time, it drove me mad the 500th time. Please just talk normally for one fucking conversation. It is not quirky or smart, it is annoying. For a book that seemingly puts major emphasis on character’s motivation, the characterization was severely lacking. Especially the women were written atrociously, they were their body and nothing more – Meredith was the main victim of this problem. Also, Richard as the villain made no sense? He was a dick for no apparent reason, other characters alluded to some dark background but it was never revealed? Okay, so I just don’t care. Additionally, why the fuck did they do anything they did? Even thinking back, this book just makes me want to scream and tear my hair out. This book is just a big fucking no.
** spoiler alert ** In this second “Outlander” book, Jamie and Claire flee to France after their thrilling escape from Black Jack Randall. In France, under the protection of Jamie’s cousin Jared, they learn that Bonnie Prince Charlie is also in France. It appears that Prince Charlie is gearing up to launch a full Jacobite rebellion, to get back the Scottish and English throne for his father King James. Claire already knows how this this rebellion ends, with the slaughter of thousands of Scots and the subsequent destruction of Highland culture. Jamie and Claire must manoeuvre the insidiousness of the French court to make sure that this ‘future’ cannot come to pass. In the ‘future’ we meet Brianna, the daughter of Jamie but also of Frank - she stands at the beginning of learning who her parents truly are and were. This second book, just like the first, is a grand story of loyalty, love, betrayal, and fighting for what you believe in. Diana, you done did it again. The Outlander series is quickly becoming a new favorite of mine. Though, I did like the first novel better than the second. I struggled a bit getting through the France chapters. At some point I completely lost track of all the names of the French court. The story progressed a little too slowly for my liking. But my attention was instantly brought back when Jamie and Claire got back to Scotland. The threatening atmosphere was coming out of the pages to get me. Especially the last few chapters, Diana held nothing back - I got whiplash from everything that she was throwing at me. If the book ends in such a thrilling way, I can’t not be excited to start the third book.Two things that particularly caught my attention. Firstly, the PTSD representation is magnificent! So many books throw in trauma without showing the effects of it. I loved (bad wording, I know) how Jamie still struggled with nightmares throughout the book. Secondly, the relationship between Jamie and Claire also feels really realistic - especially the blame they expressed towards each other after Claire’s miscarriage. Diana clearly doesn’t use trauma just for entertainments sake, it feels real and true. The characters are fully rounded with their experiences, and pain. Everything that happens has its consequences
The world has fallen into war. Ciri, the child of prophecy, has vanished. Hunted by friends and foes alike, she has taken on the guise of a petty bandit and lives free for the first time in her life. But the net around her is closing. Geralt, the Witcher, has assembled a group of allies determined to rescue her. Both sides of the war have sent brutal mercenaries to hunt her down. Her crimes have made her famous. There is only one place left to run. The tower of the swallow is waiting...My god, there is so much happening in this book, don’t know if I can take it any longer. What I have enjoyed the most so far, is Sapkowski masterful way of knitting the different narratives together. By doing so, it is clear that even the stories that seem entire unrelated will converge to the same end point – from Kenna’s trial to Bonnhart to Ciri escaping, it fits perfectly. Speaking of Bonnhart, my god, that is the scariest motherfucker I have ever read about. Literal body chills. I was on the edge of my seat whenever he popped up – I was screaming when Ciri finally, truly escaped him (the ice skating scene, yes ma’am!). Vilgefortz is a close second for being the most fucked up! Screaming, crying, throwing up, somebody save Yennefer, immediately. I really miss her in the story. Also, Yennefer almost gave me the full answer to a question that has been bugging me since three books ago: please someone, just tell me in detail what actually happened to Pavetta and Duny, the suspense is killing me. If I don’t get a complete answer at the end of this series, I will riot. As always, love Regis, love Dandelion, love Milva and I’m sure I will love Angoulême too. Though, I don’t really like Cahir’s motivation for joining the troop… You love her after meeting her once? Sure, buddy :/Lastly, and I’ve said it before, but I’m kind of stupid – thank god, I’m reading on my e-reader with dictionary, every few pages there are words that I have never heard of before. I officially relinquish my self-appointed title of being ‘a near native speaker’, clearly I am not. In the same vein, again this book had some politics in it that were very confusing and not that interesting to me. Therefore, this book is not as good as others, but still a very enjoyable read.
Irina’s life has been at a standstill for a while. Her only friend is weirdly obsessed with her, her name has been forgotten in the art world, and she has to work in a bar to sustain herself. That is, until she takes a sabbatical from her work and she’s offered an exhibition in artsy London. This is her chance to revive her career in photography. Rather than glowing up, Irina falls down a self-destructive spiral of drugs, alcohol and obsessively taking risqué pictures of men she recruits on the street. Simultaneously, she has to balance the relationship with her best friend, and a blooming relationship with a boy she met at Tesco. The balance between modelling and exploitation, and, art and crime becomes increasingly more fraught.I don’t know what I expected from this book, but definitely not this. This was a big ‘what the fuck?!?’ and ‘yes Queen, slay!!!’ rolled into one ‘I’m living for this’ type of book. Though it took me a hot second to get into it, because I had no idea where the story was going. Once I was in, I was in, baby! Any book with a complicated, morally grey woman who does questionable (in this case illegal) things but ultimately still makes me say: “good for her” is instantly going to be a favourite. I know Irina is far from a sympathetic character, in fact she is a massive bitch, but I support and love her. The characterization in this book is perfection, from Irina to Henson. Though some of their quirks might be slightly exaggerated I have seen all of them in real life. Furthermore, the way they talk to each other, and the pop culture references they use: a snapshot of real life. I’m so so impressed. And I’m genuinely scared of Irina’s mam.Additionally, I loved the view on society and its views on geneder, power, and sex this book offers. Eliza Clark knows what she is about. This book is existential in a way I have never read before. Rather than preaching her message, Eliza Clark shows how Irina’s worldview could not have been anything but the view she has because of what she experienced in life. It explains female rage in a funny, visceral, disgusting yet gripping way. Can’t believe that this is a debut novel. To me, this was perfection. (view spoiler)[ “…nothing matters and nothing lasts. Everyone forgets, and everything disappears. The things you do, the things you are; it’s all nothing. Would anyone miss you, if you went away? Would anyone look for you? Would anyone listen, or even care, if I hurt you. If I put my hands around your neck and crushed your windpipe and chopped you up, would anyone find you? And if it's a no to any of these, did you even exist in the first place?” (hide spoiler)]
When Mae is hired to work for the Circle, the worlds most powerful internet company, she feels she’s been given the opportunity of a lifetime. Run out of a sprawling California campus, the Circle links users personal emails, social media, and finances with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of transparency. Mae cant believe her great fortune to work for them - even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public.In short, this book was quite disappointing. For a number of reasons. Firstly, for a book only 11 years old, it felt very dated. The topic of social media and internet privacy has changed so rapidly, and has been discussed so extensively, the points made in the book are just old. I’m sure this book did hit way harder in 2013, than it does now in 2024. Secondly, I had hoped for a more subtly, creepy book: everything could have been darker and more in depth. So many characters literally spelled out the point being made (Mercer’s letters!), it was too on the nose and because of that also very predictable and trite. On top of that, the characterization was severely lacking. All character’s story arcs felt predetermined – their ending was already decided before the story started. There was no real character development, or a satisfying background that provides insight into their motivations. For example, it was obvious that Mercer was doomed from the very first moment he appeared on the page. Again, that made the story predictable. Fourthly, I hated how the relationships between characters were written. Nothing can convince me that Annie and Mae were actual friends, no matter how many times Mae said that they are. The way Mae spoke about Annie, so incredibly mean and dismissive. Same with Mae’s relationship with her parents, why was she so mean to them? The switch from ‘normal’ Mae to indoctrinated Mae was so sudden and unexplored, that it made that she had always been that way. Honestly, Mae infuriated me to no end, she just came across as a bitch for no apparent reason. I really did want to like this book, but I can’t. This could have been a really creepy, dystopian novel, but it was nothing more than a tired rip off of 1984 that had nothing new to add to the conversation.
In this novel, Coetzee reinvents the story of castaway Robinson Cruso written by Daniel Defoe. The story starts with Susan Barton who is marooned on the same island. Whereas Cruso and his companion the mute Friday seem content on the island, Susan has the strong urge to leave and let her story be known. After the death of Cruso and their return to England, Susan tries to get the writer Foe to tell their story. Foe does not agree with her emphasis on the island, he would rather focus on Susan’s story as a mother looking for her daughter. What this novel shows, is that there is not one truth. Perception is subjective and the story is what we make of it by using language (or the lack of it) in specific ways. Although I found this book a good read, I find that I do not have that much to say about it. I love the theme of story telling, the power is language, and how we can make those work for ourselves. Friday, a character entirely devoid of language as the juxtaposition against Susan who has this massive urge to tell her story, works amazingly well. We “know” Susan intimately, whereas Friday remains this big unknown. But I do have to say, that after a while the theme is laid on too thick and it becomes rather repetitive. I also think that the last part of this book, when Susan and Foe finally really come together, lacks the conclusion I thought would come while reading the other two parts. I lack something to tie it all together. Overall, this book does deserve its 4 out of 5 stars. It reads easily, it gives a very interesting spin to a well known story and it does offer some thought provoking paragraphs about our role as individuals in creating the reality we live in. I would definitely recommend this book, it creates another dimension in how I enjoy reading and hearing stories.
I’ve read a few books recommended on TikTok before, with a mixed result. While I wasn’t too emotionally invested in this book, it was very nice to read such an emotion novel from a different cultural perspective. It does beautifully show that love is an universal feeling and motive. The first story almost immediately turned me off. Fumiko was described as “not-another-girl”, which makes her unsympathetic to say the least. Luckily, the other three stories were way better and the last one almost had me crying. I loved the conclusion drawn from the time travel, that even when nothing changes, the outlook you have determines everything. I loved reading how Kohtake became her husband’s wife again rather than his nurse, and how Hirai reconnected with her family after being separated for years. Kei’s journey was, too me, the most heartbreaking, which parent wouldn’t want to know if their children are happy, especially if you can’t be there to witness it. Still, this book only gets 3 stars. The idea of the novel is magnificent, but the execution was a little clunky. The dialogue didn’t flow effortlessly, and the characterization seemed rushed. I would recommend this book to others though, it gives a nice glimpse into the culture of Japan.
This sequel picks up right after the end of the first novel. with the prophecy of the nameless god, Malini has declared herself Empress and has started a war to dethrone Chandra. Despite the prophecy, Malini’s claim to power is shaky at best, her followers are not as loyal as they ought to be. The continued survival of both her brothers undermine her goals. Now that Bhumika and Priya are Temple Elders, they attempt to heal the deep wounds of Ahiranya. They not only have to cleanse the Parijatdvipa’s poisonous rule but also the rot that continues to spread. Meanwhile, the yaksa power appears to be growing, and this is not the blessing it initially appears to be. The separate paths that first pulled Priya and Malini apart, are now pushing them together – together they might save the world from those that would rather watch it burn.My god this book had me screaming – I am flabbergasted! Firstly, the yaksa are so incredibly creepy, they gave me chills and nightmares. The idea that the gods they have worshipped for generations are actually scary ass monsters, I love it. God bless Bhumika for still being the level headed queen I’ve come to love. Her sacrifice is the most upsetting of them all, I just want her together with Jeevan. This was by far my most favourite storyline, Priya’s story was honestly kind of disappointing. Her stubborn, self-assured personality of book 1 was completely destroyed for her to become a tool to be used by Malini. I get that Priya loves her, but come on, she should still have agency! The ending, (view spoiler)[ with Priya stabbing Malini, (hide spoiler)] did redeem some of that – the yaksa is so scary but also compelling.Book 1 already gave me the sense that the gods are more closely related than they appear, and I loved that in book 2 the gods actually came to life. Not only physically, but also through the prophecies that all turned out to be true and related. It was great that the priests had their own motives intertwined with the royal sibling kerfuffle, (view spoiler)[ and for them to betray both Malini and Chandra – (hide spoiler)] amazing! Honestly, I always thought that Aditya was a boring character, he is just there being moody, but it all makes sense now and I appreciate him. (view spoiler)[ His willing sacrifice was a perfect resolution to the stalemate they found themselves in. Now that both her brothers have died, I have the feeling that Malini is also heading towards a gruesome death, like the priest said: “your life was always forfeit.” (hide spoiler)] I can’t wait for book 3.
This is one of those books that I just had to read, it’s that famous. In short, I’m glad that I read it, but I vehemently disagree with the core message of this book. Yet I need to give credit where credit is due, this book is valuable because it helped me put words to my personal worldview in opposition to the worldview of Coelho.This book clearly alludes to an implied structure of life and the universe, made by an omniscient being (God). This goes against how I see Life: life is chaos. We are not special, humanity and our earth are not special, there is no logical structure that is there to make us special. Everyone has opportunity to grow, although these opportunities are far from equal. With intersectional feminism in mind, it’s illogical to presume that everyone has equal chance to reach their dreams if they keep on manifesting it. You can’t say that there is equality in opportunity between a black African queer girl and a white French heterosexual boy. The (intersectional) chaos of life has made it so. The journey of the shepherd boy shows that in order to reach our destiny (whatever that might mean), you need to work, follow through and have faith. This idea might seem uplifting: we can all achieve what we want as long as we don’t lose sight of our goal. Yet I don’t read it as encouraging, I see it as huge individual pressure, when you can’t reach your goals there’s only one person to blame: yourself. In combination with the intersectional chaos that is life, a ‘self-help’ book such as this one completely disregards the reality of living in a modernized, bureaucratic, stratified society. It is simply not true that everybody can just ‘manifest’ their destiny. It also leaves me with the question: What is wrong with choosing comfort, safety and stability? It almost sounds like that people who do not constantly and actively manifest their destinies are lesser than: “that’s a lot better than dying like millions of other people, who never even knew what their destinies were.” Additionally, this view that every individual is the sole person responsively for their destiny feels scarily lonely. What happened to the saying: “it takes a village”? I’m of the believe that because of the chaos that is life, we need help to form ourselves. We need to rely on others to create a sanctuary of peace within this chaos. You don’t have to do it all alone. Lastly, and most frustratingly, why did Coelho have to do Fatima this dirty? She is literally only their to act as a life lesson along the journey the boy has to undertake to fulfill his destiny. Another women who is only characterized as a plot development. Why is her destiny not important? And come on, saying that he needs to abandon her but it’s okay because “true love”? Make it make sense, my dude. The shepherd boy is just being an asshole in this moment, no matter how many times Coelho says “Fatima is a woman of the desert, she knows men have to leave.” There is no consideration about what she wants out of life. So this is how we’re supposed to treat the people we love according to this book?This was surely a read I’m not gonna forget that easily, but not for the right reasons. I’m probably gonna stay away from “self-help” books for a while, they’re not good for my heart and soul.
** spoiler alert ** This novel chronicles the fight of Rhys, Feyre, her sisters and the other members of the Night Court against the King of Hybern, who threatens to decimate their way of life. I don’t want to think about this book anymore, so this is all the summary I’m going to write.With the second book only being slightly beter than the first, I had hope that this upward trajectory would continue for this instalment. Sadly no, it is even worse than I could have imagined, it took serious strength to continue reading this trash. The previous critiques on the writing style still stand (I don’t want to hear/read the word ‘mate’ ever again). And the characters are still insufferable. A few specific points that really pissed me off:Firstly, the possessiveness last book was annoying, in this book it is absolutely infuriating. For a series in which we supposedly should like Feyre for her independent strong nature, the plot is weirdly filled with too much female objectification. Feyre appears to be ‘just’ Rhys’ mate and nothing else. Even worse is the “relationship” between Lucien and Elain… She is like property to him.Secondly, what’s up with the constant ‘vulgar gestures’? What does it mean? Why does everybody constantly chuckle about it? And why is this apparently the only way characters are able to end a conversation? Freaking annoying!Thirdly, I absolute hate hate HATED using Mor’s gayness as such a plot point. That Feyre used Mor’s personal relationship as a counter to Feyre’s obvious irresponsible behaviour was already too much, but then having to read how Mor was basically forced to come out? Disgusting. This is not good LGBTQ+ representation, it is actually rather harmful. Fourthly, why is the ending so obnoxious? All threats are rendered meaningless when all main characters survive, I would have enjoyed it way more if (especially) Rhys and Amren had died. And don’t get me started on the annoying life lessons randomly placed in the last third of the book: “Leave this world … a better place than how you found it” – yeah no thanks. Lastly, the villain the King of Hybern is also such an unbelievable threat. How am I to believe that he is all powerful, when not one but two of his close confidants (Jurian and Tamlin) were actually betraying him the whole time without his knowledge? It is so unbelievable. Still going to finish the series, but only out of spite.
amazing dialogs and very interesting characters. will read it again in the near future to see if I can understand the language better- it felt as if I couldn’t get all the stories because I didn’t know all the words. favourites are;a perfect day for banana fishthe laughing maninteresting dialogs;for esmépretty mouth and green my eyes
As from today I will hold Pnin - the character - close to my heart forever. What an absolute lump of a guy. At times, I couldn't be quite bothered with the story, but the endearing clumsyness that this 'pathetic academic' has, was worth the while. Will definitely re-read this novel again, maybe next year. Nice and detailed way of writing, love that aswell!What I didn't quite get - or what I may have completely missed in the storyline - is who the narrator, this good friend of Pnin, is?
a manditory read <3
2,5* -this book has some very beautiful parts and some very uncomfortable parts (not the good kind). the casual tone in which this book is written really works, but I could have done without the judgemental tone. overall it took me to a few interesting thoughts, which is all I would ask from a book. so for that, I thank you
I mean three stars as a positive review!! I overall really enjoyed the stories. I especially loved the first one (cannibals). I’m really into the concepts of all the stories but the way it was written didn’t always grasp my full attention. I only ever got to reading the first one of the miss peregrines book line, but I really recommend reading this book to anyone who’s into those! fun fun
My favourite little book, even though I wasn’t into all of the stories. Because the one’s I did enjoy I fell utterly and completely in love with. Amazing concepts and beautiful writing. You shape quite a world ms Woolf <3
** spoiler alert ** the book has some slow parts and it should’ve/could’ve definitely been shorter. I loved the first and the last part. in the second part-although interesting to read about the way they hosted en thought about the games before they made it such a show- was again, a little to slow for me.I didn’t think I’d enjoy reading about snow so much. you can really see his controlling and ambitious traits being a big part of his identity already and the book was definitely not made to make us sympathize with him (and I’m glad it wasn’t). the falling in love with the district 12 tribute was a bit on the nose but I loved lucy gray’s character. their storyline together was really interesting aswell. especially the part about the hanging tree made me want to reread the original triology again.the prominent aspect of music is almost annoying-as snow points out himself aswell- which makes you understand how annoyed he must’ve been hearing katniss sing or hearing anything uncontrolling out of her (and others).not sure if I’d read it again very quickly, but dispite the dominance of bad reviews I actually enjoyed it a lot and could barely stop myself reading the next chapter.
** spoiler alert ** 3.5I liked the twists and turns, but I feel like the resolution was kind of anticlimactic. It is kind of the whole point of the book, but all this build up led to nothing in the end. So many misleading clues and seemingly useless information...
I give this book 3.5 stars.
** spoiler alert ** Slaugherhouse Five is a book about Billy Pilgrim, a war veteran with a strange ability to arbitrarily travel in time. One day Billy gets kidnapped by the Tralfamadorians, who put him on display in a zoo. There he learns that time is everything and everywhere. As the Tralfamadorians always experience all of time. So it goes.Kurt Vonnegut has a very clever style of writing. In Slaughterhouse Five he himself seems to be the narrator, as he regularly writes paragraphs in first person when talking about the Second World War. Furthermore, the time skips add a lot to this book. They are seemingly random, but the reader always returns to the main story about Billy after he's been captured and sent to the Slaughterhouse Five, which gives the reader a sense of a clear plot while also experiencing all of it at the same time.
** spoiler alert ** (Wrote this review while preparing for the C2 cambridge exam, stole the idea from a friend hehe)What would you do if you were confronted with the choice between your personal interest and the good of your community? This is the question that many people in communities all around the world face. People such as Asher Lev from the acclaimed novel written by Chaim Potok titled My Name is Asher Lev.My Name is Asher Lev follows a young jew called Asher Lev who is trying to figure out his identity as an artist and a jew following the events of the second world war. He lives in New York in a strictly orthodox sect of jews with his parents, Aryeh and Rivkeh Lev. His father works for the Rebbe and is therefore an important figure in the community. Conflict arises between him and his son when Asher Lev starts defying the rules set upon him by his religion for the sake of his art.I was deeply touched by the story of Asher Lev. His struggle to fit in with his peers because of his passion felt familiar. In a world where everyone is made to fit the same mold it is crucial to be able to pursue your own interests. However, if pursuing your passions means sacrificing all your connections to your family, it doesn't seem as intuitive to follow your dreams anymore. This makes Asher's choice to leave everything he has known behind all the more compelling. This effect is further amplified by the first person perspective in this book. Every event is seen through the perspective of Asher Lev. Making the book even more enticing.All in all, My Name is Asher Lev is a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about Jewish traditions and how they affect people who deviate from them, for only by educating people on these traditions can we destigmatize following your own path through life.
** spoiler alert ** Having grown up on Sherlock Holmes I was always a bit sceptical of Agatha Christie. I always saw her as competition for Arthur Conan Doyle... My thought process is weird at times. Now I see that this isn't true.Both Agatha Christie and sir Arthur Conan Doyle write stories with many unpredictable twists and turns. I'm used to being able to predict plotlines in movies, but this book startled me greatly. As a bit of a 20th century history fan, it was very fun to read this spy novel. The threat of a new war, the different factions trying to prevent or start it, the global significance of the mission succeding... Though I would have liked to learn more about the third faction and their motives. They seemed a bit shallow at times.Another problem I found was the speed of the finale. The time between Victoria finding out about Edward being the mastermind and her rescue was too short. So the tension built up by the book didn't feel as resolved.
** spoiler alert ** Damn, I don't think I ever finished reading a book this fast. As opposed to the very outspoken minority of haters, I really liked the ideas behind the story. A man om a journey to finding the answers to the questions which most troubled his life. A seemingly simple and meaningless life turned out to have a major impact. While it may be cliche, I don't think that it's an issue, as the method of storytelling is quite unique. So yeah. Apparently I am 'emotionally weak' now.I was also intrigued by the way the book was written, though I didn't agree with every stylistic choice (the repeating of those lines at the beginning and end of a paragraph felt very movie-y). Reading this book felt more like watching a movie. I could imagine many scenes taking place on a screen. Dramatic acting, lighting, composition.One thing I liked less, is the introduction of random characters. It would be nice if they had some kind of Introduction. More 'Show, don't tell.'
** spoiler alert ** Goddamn, Agatha Christie is a brilliant writer of detectives. As I've said in my review of "They Came to Baghdad" I am used to being able to deduce the anwser to these types of plots. Here, however, I was constantly on the edge of my seat.This book poses many questions about justice, which, as a (pretentious) lover of philosophy, I think are very interesting to think about. When is justice served? And should you take charge when you believe a situation to be unjust? How unethical can your treatment of another be, when they have committed unethical crimes? ...However, this book is still a detective. It doesn't deal with the topic of justice very deeply. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
** spoiler alert ** I was very interested in this book. I thought that the way that Alex spoke, was caused by the things the government put him through (i heard a few spoilers). But it just turned out to be the way he normally spoke. Which to me was weird, as in the last few pages Alex realises that he grew up, but he still kept his old way of speaking. Alex started "writing" the book after he had his realization. But his manner of speech hasn't changed.What also bugged me was how pointless the middle part of the book was for the plot and character development. Alex underwent this experiment, only to return to his normal ways a day after he got out into the real world. Only to realize a year later that he doesn't want to be violent anymore, which had nothing to do with the experiment.However, this book did capture a somewhat dystopian vibe. The police and the government don't seem to be operating for the normal citizen, but seem to just want to increase their own pleasure and power. Which was very interesting to read in a book like this.
While reading this book I was very inspired. I really like art, literature and philosophy. So reading about these philosophers arguing with each other made me very excited. I am even more looking forward to studying philosophy, writing, making art... However, I found the content of the book quite repetitive at times. I don't know exactly how to describe it, but I felt bored or annoyed because I felt that I had read a passage before. I am also more interested in the philosophical aspects instead of the history, but that's a personal preference.This book is non-fiction, but written as a novel. I found this very confusing at first, but this aspect made me more sympathetic to the characters (except Friedrich Schlegel and Dorothea Veit, ugh) and interested in the history.I love the way Wulf described all the drama between these romantics.
** spoiler alert ** 70% women, 30% ????This book follows David, who upon entering his paint studio finds a woman who calls himself his wife and two of his children. He never had children. He has entered a new life, his ideal life. Finally escaping the in-between of society's expectations and his own dreams.If I had to describe this book, I'd say it is a pornographic hallucinatory trip of a man unsatisfied with his life. The book tries to be deep, but everything that happens feels scattered and random. David getting completely lost in a apartment building, suddenly gaining his ideal wife and children, photographs all turning into portraits of people he knows... Taunting him about the shitty life he had, but suddenly giving him the chance to live the life he always dreamed of. Why? How? Maybe the absurdity is the point, but in that case the book was too unrealistic.Furthermore, the language was very off-putting. Pubic mound? Refering to genitals as a 'sex'? The 'isn't it?' after every vaguely deep sentence?? The text seems very unnatural. But then again, this whole book is surreal and unnatural. Most of my review has been about the 30% of substance, but I haven't even started on the numerous female characters just FALLING at the feet of our protagonist. The female characters' only personality seems to be 'omg David I love you and can't live without you,' or trying to conceal this fact. The four adult female characters were all there to be 'his.' EVEN HIS NEW DAUGHTER. I don't wanna know why this sentence was included. To disturb the audience? In that case it worked really well. David was bathing his children. When his daughter asked him to dry her 'butterfly.' WHY DID THIS HAVE TO BE INCLUDED??? WHY DID THE AUTHOR FIND THIS BEAT SO COMPELLING TO WRITE IT INTO THE STORY?? To show how uncomfortable and disturbed the main character is? Well, I'm not sure, as in the next scene he's already trying to get his new wife to sleep with him.I found this book in my parents' bookshelves, and it will probably stay there for a while...
** spoiler alert ** The short stories were very hit or miss for me, but the hits hit hard. I especially liked the stories where no crimes were involved, such as The Man from the Sea and Harlequin's Lane. Most stories were pretty predictable, but that's only natural when they're so short. The twists and turns happen a few pages after the exposition, so you don't really forget earlier information. However, the emotional character of the stories is what seperates this book from other crime novels. Mr Satterthwaite, the 'detective,' isn't a man in a long coat smoking a pipe in front of a fire deducing some crime. He's an old man who knows much about people and their emotions. I really liked the character of mr Satterthwaite, even though I have no idea how to pronounce his name. He's very relatable to me, constantly observing and listening to others and the world around him, although I haven't lived as long as he has. Harley Quin was also a very enjoyable character. His existence is very open to interpretation, which makes the stories even more intriguing. What does he represent?
** spoiler alert ** I quite liked this book, despite there being no chapters. In fact, the chapterless-ness added a lot of speed to the reading process.This book describes the last 3-4 days of a German soldier who suddenly realizes that he doesn't have long to live. He will die soon... Soon... When is soon? It is such a vague word. Intentionally so.I found the thoughts of this doomed soldier very interesting. It brings so much humanity to these people who are often overly praised or antagonized just for doing their job. Maybe they're thinking of the love they never had, or of the love they once had but now have lost. Or they're thinking of the horrible acts that they have comitted, or of what has been done to them. So many perspectives and only through the eyes of one man.Our main character keeps trying to find out when, where and how he'll die. However, in trying to escape his fate he eventually meets his end. Him and the people he loved in the last few days of his miserable life.
** spoiler alert ** I really liked the structure of the book. Telling the history of Philosophy while also providing a plot made it a very interesting book to read. I also really enjoyed the meta-ness of this book. This way the readers not only learned about philosophy, but also applied the skills needed to understand it. It makes you wonder whether you are also part of a book. Merely a means to another end.However, I found some mistakes or misformulations of some Philosophers' theories I vaguely knew. This could be a translation problem. However, it made me question how many other theories were misrepresented.
** spoiler alert ** I read this book in Russian, however my Russian language skills aren't good ebough to write so I will write my review in English.I really love Bulgakovs writing style. It is very engaging and comical when needed. His use of repitition and personification stood out to me the most. I found reading this book quite enjoyable despite the long and complicated sentences.I am, however, left with questions that the book couldn't anwser for me.1. What was the point of Satan's Ball? I understood that sinners where invited to attend it, but why?2. Why were the Master and Margarita declared missing in the epilogue when in the chapter before it they were revealed to have passed away?3. Is there any significance to the story of Pontius Pilate in relation to this book? There is a large emphasis on the fact that Master has written a book on him, but why him specifically?Despite some confusion I found this a very beautiful book. I am usually not a fan of romance in stories, but the romance between the Master and Margarita was very beautiful and didn't feel "cringe" as many other love stories do for me. Voland and his gang were very funny (I loved the cat). The way they used their magic was very interesting and usually meant to teach people a lesson in a more subtle way than I would've guessed. Great book.
Yeesh, this book was miserable, but I guess that's kind of the point. 3.5I really like how Yozo describes the human condition seemingly through the outsiders perspective. Although, now that I think about it, he probably was more human than he thought. He made the same mistakes everyone could make. Thoughts and actions alike.I guess that don't have many coherent thoughts about the book. Often I just tried to read it as fast as possible to not have to listen to Yozo's constant yapping.I'm not very sympathetic towards him. He fucked up his own life, but as least he realises that.
I didn't find this plot as intriguing as other Agatha Christie books. I don't know whether it's fatigue or this book that made me disinterested. Maybe the crime was too contrived, but I'm not sure.Miss Marple was a funny character though.
Damn. I heard that this book was written as an excuse to distribute pornography without labelling it as such, but that couldn't be further from the truth. I love that the dystopian world in this book was formed only a few years before the events of the book take place. Through the narrator we get a glimpse in the past and how it is slowly forgotten. The protagonist, 'Offred,' has somehow resisted the indoctrination of the Gileadean society. Although the system of this society is quite absurd from time to time, it makes sense when looking at modern ideologies and taking them to the extreme. The rapid decline in freedom seems like something that could happen in our world as well, that is the scary part.Antoher aspect of this book that I loved was Margaret Atwood's writing style. The subtlety of her metaphor's was something I could think about all day. There was so much emotion in the words of this broken woman. A particular quote I adore is 'we lived in the gaps between the stories.' Offred reflects on her life before Gilead and connects her reflection to the present through the past tense. Wow.This book also made me think a lot about how lucky I am to be born in the 21st century in a Western country as a woman. There are so many possibilities in front of me that people elsewhere may not have. The fact that I've had the chance to learn how to read and have the means to read this book is wonderful, but how long can this freedom last? How long will it be before the population starts declining and young, fertile women will be needed? How long until my right to bodily autonomy will be taken away? These dags ideologies seem to be getting more extreme every day. When will extremism dominate our world? How long til every last copy of this book will be destroyed?
I really liked the beginning of the book, but near the middle my interest started to slip. The middle felt very slow, even though that was the part where the most time had passed.Part 4 felt like something from a Dan Brown novel, which doesn't really fit in with the rest of the book. Even if it was the point, it felt too random...
** spoiler alert ** I think I would have liked this book more if it wasn't so misogynistic. Most of female characters were very one dimensional, only caring for the men in the story. Furthermore, one of the most prevalent messages in the book was women having more interest in men that abuse them, and that that's the way to make a woman love you...Maugham's style of writing is very interesting. He uses vocabulary that I have never seen before and he has a very mesmerizing way of explaining feelings. However, I still found this book quite dreadful to get through at times. Especially after the death of Strickland in the novel. As the part I liked the most about this book was the dynamic between Strickland and other characters, which wasn't shown after his death.
** spoiler alert ** why did it took so long for them to get married i was WAITING smh
** spoiler alert ** unpopular opinion but verity carried this book she was so funny lmao. Like the way she scared the living shit out of Lowen and prob traumatized her for life💀💀 I believe the manuscript because the letter was just so random like out of the blew. However i am still team verity bc i found lowen annoying as fuck
this book made me cringe so hard “my Norwegian bad boy” GIRL PLZ
Having been a fan of his music for some years now, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Dave Grohl has written a book during the pandemic (as well, a lot of people did. So what?). And boy is it funny. And emotional at times. Telling all kinds of stories from his life, from being a kid to meeting former President Obama in the White House (and with a friendly reminder to never take a loo break in the garden's bushes, for "there are people in the bushes"), Grohl made me laugh very frequently, and almost tear me up with not just the story of him coping with the death of Kurt Cobain, but also him writing so fondly about Taylor Hawkins, who would die not that long after publication of the book. The way in which it is all written down, like he's talking to the reader as if they were in the room is a hats-off to his writing skills and the editors for keeping it that way. There are plenty of moments you know from the front, like the time he broke his foot in Ullevi and continued the show. The very funny retelling of him dealing with his first heartbreak. And a lot of his scribbled notes inbetween the texts are like life lessons. The most intriguing one? 'Every day is still a blank page waiting to write itself.'
Hard, brutal at times, but honest and every now and then blatantly hilarious. It's what I've come to know and appreciate about how Bourdain used to tell his stories about food and the culture behind it in his television programmes I've seen up to now. He really opens the world of the kitchen to the reader, with various degrees of surprise, but despite this, I'm sure to give his other works a go.
It is one of those classic dystopian literature works in the vein of Orwell, Huxley, etc. A what if, this time about a society where stories itself have become illegal. Predicting the snippet, 'Too-long-didn't-read' culture we are more and more living in everyday, the fire brigade has become a burning inquisitorial squad, quenching fires of creativity and literary hunger rather than the infernos that could flatten entire cities. But what if one fireman starts asking the question, 'What am I burning?' and 'Why?'A quick read, but one that sometimes eerily rings true. I reckon the people that made Wall-E were also partly inspired by this.
It's being lauded as a great book and a great read, but I took a good long while until I actually got into it. Love the setting and the premise of a story about Henry VIII's most trusted advisor, but the POV was very confusing for me for about half the book. With about a dozen people called 'Thomas' and 'he' being the most common pronoun by a stretch in this male-dominated tale, it can be difficult to understand exactly who is speaking when, something I usually have less trouble with when reading a book such as this. The story is rich, sometimes almost convolutingly so, in a way that you constantly need to remind yourself of people or their positions, as well of the context of the time when the English Reformation began in earnest, and the major and minor players in that game. Mantel does make a great effort of making the story go fast and slow, hooks the reader on the thinking processes of Cromwell, who as a person working himself up in the world, goes from neutral to sympathetic figure to cold schemer throughout the course of this book. By showing the various perspectives of the different people involved, it also shows that all players have a different stake in the game, making everyone guilty to some extent to the situation they find themselves in. Now that I know Mantel's style, I'm more keen to read the other two parts in the series. And just one last little gripe: was 'fourpenny f*ck' really an expression back in 1535? I doubt it, to be honest, and that broke the wall for a little bit for me. A great tale with a lot of potential, one that sets your brain to work, but with some things that are hopefully improved in Bring up the Bodies and The Mirror and the Light.
Starts weird, until you know what is actually going on with Holden Caulfield. I always need to get used to this stream-of-consciousness style, but it gives a good view of exactly what Caulfield thinks and says.
We read this as part of our preparation for our own marriage (which is kind of a given when looking at the title and our background). But honestly, non-Christians could do quite well reading this book, too, when considering to have a solid relationship that could very well culminate in a marriage. While some chapters may suit them less due the message that Keller brings remains that marriage is both given by God and Christ's relation with the Church is considered an archertype of the marital union, the book gives valuable advice for anyone willing to go that distance. Because saying 'I do', and all the vows that follow are far from always easy to uphold. Keller also talks about the apparent mismatch between his original basis for this book, being a series of sermons on marriage for a congregation based in NewYork, and the demography in said congregation, which consisted of quite the amount of single people.
Don't really know what to say about this one, other than that it's a brilliant piece. Like a Russian doll, this story spreads out and reveals a new world every time you open the next part. Intriguingly, the stories all seem to be linked, by chance or by the fates that bind each main character. Meanwhil, every cloud in the sky represents a different animal when looked at from a different angle, so these 'clouds' float along and take our imaginations and thoughts with them, page by page, mark by mark. I do feel a twang of nuisance, because of the 'And then?! But how?!' questions that keeps coming back. Figures the investment a reader will have when reading these stories.
This set of speeches can be seen as one of Kierkegaard's simpler works, although it still is quite the read. Interesting material for the reader that gets past Kierkegaard's sentence structure and elaborate style.
Is this a literary book? Not much. Is it a well-written book? It could do better. Does it not too subtly try to play on emotions at times? Sure. Is it obviously trying to tell you something by using 'lesson' in the chapter titles? Definitely. Does that mean it is a bad little book? No. Depending on the time in your life you pick this up, this may not be for you at all. Or it may actually mean a lot. And that is what books primarily are for. I can think of plenty of other books to satisfy my need for intellectual headscratching, high-level literary analysis or the more subtle life journey. But I think this book is a little nugget nonetheless, because it gave me a story on grief, a (for me) not usually visited perspective on afterlife, and the ponderings of a dead person questioning what his life was all for. And that took my off guard sometimes, with a very recent loss of someone close to me echoing throughout this. And it succeeded in giving me some escapism and some emotional solace for a short time. For that, I thank this book.
The second volume of His Dark Materials. I started this once before, but left it unfinished. Picked it up years later and finished it quite quickly. Pullman's storytelling is very good, and even though some elements referencing Christianity brush a bit against my faith, the story, the characters and the world that Pullman has created parallel to our own are really well-crafted. Sucked into the dilemmas characters face, feeling the fear related to the Spectres, but also reading this as an adult with a literary background makes this a very intruiging tale. One volume left, I can't wait to read the conclusion.
I once was almost pushed into the works of Joyce, as one of my professors was a devout Joycean and wished us all to be the same. While not into it at the time, it became one of many books on my list to read at some point in the future. That time came now, and I see where my professor came from, even though the style of 'Portrait' is one I feel at home with. The stream of consciousness, that is. At first, I had a bit trouble to connect to Stephen and his tale, too, but as he grew, so did my appreciation for both the story and the style. Centred around various epiphanies through the course of Stephen's younger years, we see a person come of age as an artist and as a human being. Fascinating how Joyce paints with not too many words, unless necessary. Ultimately, I enjoyed this very much.
This is the nook Jonathan Safran Foer is most likely most known for, and it's not hard to figure out why. By times magnanimously and at other times tearfully sad, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close plays, most of all, with the reader's feelings, at least it did with mine. which is funny, because the entire book seems to be about people who either cannot or dare not share their feelings openly with the people they are, or were closest to. Another question that remains is where it all leads to in the end, but the journey throughout the book may have made wanting to know what the Black key exactly opened obsolete. Foer's way of playing with graphology is brilliantly done, adding another interesting layer to the book, something I'd like to see more of.
Michael Ignatieff shares his experiences as a former politician, a life that contained both successes and (great) failures. Ignatieff shows how he has dealt with either, and gives the reader some valuable advice, whether they are politically interested, involved, or not: the lessons are valuable for life in general as well. A very decent read, not in the least because it has been translated adequately. Unfortunately, there are some mistakes here and there, but overall, the Dutch text makes the reader feel why Ignatieff ultimately fell victim to the ruthless world of politics
One of the pinnacle works in the early Christian church. St. Augustine poses not only his thoughts on his own life, but also dishes out some more philosophical confessions. Despite the book being over 1500 years old, quite a lot of Augustine's thoughts are more relevant today than one might think.
** spoiler alert ** Aldous Huxley, limited by Systems and Symbols, decides to take mescalin as a way of opening his doors of perception. What follows is a philiosophical journey past colours, increased sensory activity and the realization that we live in a limited world, limited by each and every system we choose to attend, learn, master or follow.
While not as gripping and mindboggingly fascinating as its predecessor Kitchen Confidential, Bourdain's way of storytelling still gets me. Sometimes blisteringly funny, at other times plainly depressing or infuriating, it contains a lot of the things I love about his work. Sadly, it has also made sure I never get to work in a professional kitchen, but it has learnt me, again, to have respect for the entire chain from the farmer, fisher, butcher, all the way to the waiter bringing me my food. Even though they may not give a clusterf*ck about that, according to Bourdain.
Not a travel tale that I am used to from this marvellous storyteller, but a book on the language that I studied. A comprehensive, albeit not academic work on the history of the English language. Bryson writes from two perspectives, given that he has lived in both the UK and the USA, so he gives a view on two distinct forms on English, but also on a multitude of other varieties, and other languages and their sometimes very quirky comparison to English. Written with Bryson's typical humour and wit, the book gave me a retelling of some of my study work, new insights beyond that, and quite the amount of chuckles never found in the lecture notes of old. For anyone doing the Varieties of English course at Utrecht University, don't hesitate to read this next to the stuff you'll get to study and it comes alive where you stand. There is even a bibliography in the back, so you may find some interesting material to use for an essay on the matter, too!And I'll never look at dictionaries the same way, that's for sure.
Eerie, gloomy, and at times quite saddening. I definitely hope this does not happen somewhere in a wind farm for real. Two people stuck in a place, a life even, that is going nowhere. Gripping tale, but the weather described really reflects the mood you get from this book.
Great read about the life of a boy and his extraordinary journey. A vivid way of writing by Martel, and the book contains some very interesting views on different parts of life, too. Really sunk into this one throughout reading it.
A delightful story from a great storyteller. Bryson has a real gift in mocking everything he writes about in an endearing manner, while at the same time giving the reader some nice, though sometimes quite irrelevant information throughout his stories. This one is no different: we can basically walk alongside him when he tells about his walks through the British countryside, and paints a lovely picture.
I read the Dutch translation once before, and even though this is the original language, it got me the first time, which is why I came back to it in the first place. Great read!
Took some time to finish this, due to me having Ted Hughes' poems next to it as well. The story itself, a grieving family learning to cope with the loss of the mother, is almost a sidetrack when you read 'Crow' simultaneously. The obsession of the father with Hughes and his poetry is somewhat estranging, but the concept of the Crow from these poems visiting, watching, and in its own morbid way, helping the family deal with their grief (while posing as the manifestation of grief as well, interestingly) is a nice way to construct a tale. And not only has Porter used (maybe his own fascination with) Hughes in the story, he has tried to emulate Hughes' style as well. I like the result.
An amazing read for a story that's simply about rabbits. I mostly remember this tale as a television series back when I was a little kid. And boy, did it seem scary then! I applaud Mr. Adams for creating such a vast, thoroughly entertaining, gripping, and emotional tale about rabbits while driving his car and entertaining his children. A classic tale which I will cherish and, hopefully, will be able to pass on. Thrilled!
A gentle and mildly humourous tale of a man wrestling with the elements in a forlorn house while scavenging herbs, this was was a nice slow-read, but nothing went very deep. So it's not a guide to herbology, or a 'how to renovate a derelict mansion', and not even a 'how to turn my dull London-bound life around', but more of 'a year in the life of...'. Nice, but not really elevating. It has made me curious about the house and its surroundings, though.
An eerie description of how the world could be if there was something as total control. How free are we, really, in our actions and our thoughts? And how many people may know of the thoughts that are roaming inside your head? Orwell has given the world a very decent piece of dystopian fiction with '1984'.
Another World War II autobiography that did not fail to grab me. The things a human being may become when put in a position the people described in this work have been shoved into is a gruesome thing to behold. If This is a Man, then what else is left?
Wonderfully weird, but a tad dry for my taste.
The second installment in Martin's masterpiece continues the great story of the Seven Kingdoms. New players step on the board and play their devious games. This becomes clear after about 150 pages; before that mark, it's somewhat harder to read. Once you've worked yourself through that bit, though, it becomes once again a massive page-turner.
It becomes convoluted in Westeros: while the death tally raises ever higher, the characters seem to increase in number even after five page turners. However, I like this fleshed-out world, with names and plots aplenty. And even though Winter has set its foot in the door, the story about the Seven Kingdoms is still far from completion. Who will ultimately survive to rule the world?
"The sky is a powder blue. Over the playing fiels are the cones and cubes of distant towers. Blinking bright dots of light."This is how this amazing, but very touching book ends. It's the beginning of a lot of people's ideas about London. A chance at a better future, hope for something to bring home to their families, if there is anything left. This is London. This is a city with around 9 million people, of which the majority is not born there, and plenty of people in this metropolis don't own the citizenship of the country. One of if not the biggest melting pot in Europe, London houses so many nationalities, that the 'traditional British person' has become a minority. Judah meets many of the city's inhabitants, in particular the ones who have been tempted by golden promises, dots of hope. Many of the people he interviews have not that been lucky. The Nigerian policeman, applying for the job the Met wanted more black police officers, has made it 'out'. Many Eastern Europeans live on the streets, or overcrowd small, poorly tended houses. Many other African people do the jobs nobody else wants to do, cleaning rich kids' excrement from tube stations in the darkest of nights. A rich Middle-Eastern princess is cooped up, while the Polish registrar has helped people become legal residents through marriage, despite knowing their original aim was illegal. Stories that Judah has managed to convey perfectly, by going undercover and living their lives. It shows London's two faces, or as the Sectioner describes it: "I imagine London as two buildings... The first building is the one that accommodates London's science and technology: in this building we have moved from gliders to supersonic. We have moved from typewriters to the most high-powered computer systems, even voice-controlled ones... [...] This building has become a skuscraper. We can see its glory... But now the other building. [...] This other building deals with... London's emotion. It controls the feeling. The emotion that makes up our social interaction. But unfortunately this building is still at the foundation level... They are working by candlelight... The building is staffed by cavemen. In fact nobody has done any building for thousands of years. And there is a rising damp. [...] Unless we develop our emotions... London is very unstable."In a city that goes many miles an hour, communities segregate, finding their fellow people and not really knowing neighbours, let alone the man sleeping on concrete or the woman parading the back alleys. It's a city I live in now. And while I'm very much not one of the people Judah has interviewed, this book has given me a very gnarly image of this city, one I cannot easily shake when traversing its lanes and buildings. Welcome to London.
It's weird, really. This story was recommended to me during my studies, partly because of the interesting challenges it would pose me as a translator. Also, it was mentioned that the story is weird in itself. A man jumping through time and space to relive his life, during which he experienced multiple horrors. However, the horrors are described in quite the factual fashion, with the most apathic phrase being the MC's catchphrase whenever something related to death is mentioned: So it goes. Despite the timejumps, an interesting read about, say, seven different timelines. Granted, not the best fragmented novel I have ever read, but Vonnegut has does a fine job with this.
Ah. A classic, easy sword and sorcery, but one of those that created a whole fanbase and spin offs before the word became a tired tv trope. The grumpy, lonely Geralt who wants one destiny but gets another is introduced with a plethora of other characters most people will instantly recognise from either the games or the series. A nice spin on the fantasy genre, with certain magic rules and world building elements I had not yet seen in other works. And because it's easily digestible from a reading difficulty perspective, it was a nice distraction from the other books on my list.
Quite a bonkers detective, in which it becomes harder and harder to see what the truth is due to the deteriorating view of the factual situation by the protagonist. Cleverly hidden details steer you in a certain direction, only to veer into a different alley the next. To figure out what exactly is amiss is what makes this a detective, but you could classify this as a conspiracy novel just the same. A re-read from my study days, and a decent revisit at that.
** spoiler alert ** This part of Pullman's tale was a bit disappointing for me. Interesting concepts for sure, but the titular object does play very much less of a role than the previous two. And that's rather telling, to be honest. While the Spyglass is somewhat instrumental for Mary Malone (a crude wordplay on Mary Magdalene, but seemingly without reason, a chance that the anti-catholic Pullman really missed if he wanted an additional literary layer with regards to that theme) discovering the stream of Dust and what ails the world because of it, it is only briefly that it shines, and not as fleshed out and built up as it was with the knife or the alethiometer. While the fantasy worlds are described quite beautifully, its inhabitants and contents are becoming more and more convoluted. Why the attacks on the mulefa, if the bigger problem of the dying trees wasn't already posing enough of a threat? Too many creatures and locations without a properly fleshed-out context hinder the story rather than enhance it. Which is a shame, really. And the given reason why a daemon settles just felt off to me. I do want to know more about why the servants get a dog-daemon once their daemon was touched by a loved one that you truly trust, for example. Quite some stuff Pullman could have worked out better and instead cut out other things.Still, there are nice parts, too. And the ending is quite gutwrenchingly cruel for a YA/coming-of-age tale that you wished had a happy ending. The episode through the world of the dead gave me chills (imagine being there), and certain twists and turns related to Coulter's allegiances put me on edge in that you just don't know what she'll ultimately do. Would I re-read this trilogy? There's my faith, or at least a parallel of the church being scorned, that's icky. But looking past that, because dogma can indeed be darker than a visit to Charon and his boat. There is a tale in this that started off magnificently, but ended lower than the story as a whole deserved. So part 1 and 2, I really liked, and I would be inclined to point others towards those tales to really read them. The final part let me down, though.
It reminds me somewhat of James Joyce's Dubliners. Similar gloomy tales of individuals in a time of hardship (the Great War being the culprit this time) in early Twentieth century England. People are overcome by feelings, situations, makes them do things they rationally would not want, but it just happens to them, with no way to counter it. The stories tend to not give a conclusion to the problem posed either, and the reader leaves the characters in each tale as they usually found them: lost in their own web of (little) difficulties and distractions.
Wonderfully written! This book is poetic philosophical, and strikes awe about the places under our feet. I did not think I would like a book 'about caving', but MacFarlane has made it about so much more than that. Because more than just looking, what do we take from the Earth, but moreover, what do we leave in it? The question 'Are we being good ancestors?' returns a couple of times, and rings clearly through your mind throughout the entire book. Perilous at times, MacFarlane's travels to the underlands he visits also inspire wonder about these places, inaccessible as they may feel for someone who's not that wild about looking for the extreme, i.e. me. His style of writing is inviting, makes me feel at home in his experiences, and a mental tag-along during his more thorough ventures into the underland. I enjoyed this book very much, but it has given me thoughts aplenty about how ridiculous we humans can be at times.
A thoroughly well-written journal, interwoven with so many personal stories that you really find yourself a companion on the author's journey. I personally love the northern part of Great Britain, but have so far not visited the Border region that Stewart describes. It is interesting to read the history of the area as well as the many anecdotes told by the people he meets. It gave me a better understanding of the division between Scotland and England, as well as the lack of logic that sometimes seems te be behind the sentiment. The country itself tells quite an amount of tales as well, and at the end you discover the thread that holds this tale together: Mr. B. Stewart and the bond he has with his son.
Eerie at times, but gripping all over. And while the front cover of my edition states that this book (deservedly, imo) had won the 2012 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction, I sometimes thought that at least some of it had to be at least somewhat fictional, to strengthen the images shown in this story. But the author's afterword debunks that thought, so... Yeah. Boo is a good writer, judging by this tale. She made me feel for each person whose story she told, and managed to convey a factual, but still very vivid telling about the life in an Indian slum, doomed for demolition, but busy and full of people to make something of their lives nonetheless. The matter-of-fact tone about how some of the frankly disgusting events are experienced by the POV characters make it a good Non-Fiction book in my opinion. And boy, is it gross sometimes, both in the most literal sense of the word as in the way the corruption seems to have its tendrils in the entire power system sometimes.
Sort of leaves you hanging, having an overview of the entire Targaryen Dynasty as an appendix, but stopping halfway. It does show that the contents are gripping enough to wait, and it is clear to each reader why HBO decided it was good material to use for a spin-off of GoT. Visually stunning with the drawings provided by Wheatley, this chronicle starts off slowly. Almost too slowly, but later the plotting, warring and scheming that we know of Martin's other work kick into high gear. Part of this has now been liberally visualised in HotD. For the viewer, be glad that this book has plenty more to give before the series' and the book's pace start to match (provided they decide they stop at Aegon III and actually wait for the second one to be finished this time around).Do not forget that there is a Targaryen family tree in the back of this edition, for sometimes it's hard to keep track of all the different people with the same, or very similar names. But a colourful description of most people involved make up of this somewhat convoluted family and their close associates, kin, and (fr)enemies. Having the interjections from two, sometimes three different perspectives (including Mushroom's outrageously funny ones) give the tales more depth, too. Nice accompanying read in-between books 5 and 6 of the main story (Yes, I too am still waiting for TWoW), and interested to see what the second half of this Targaryen tale will bring.
Filled with quick wit and jabs at anything remotely related to the history of the oh so glorious Dutch history of football and the most humble position each of the sixteen million head coaches The Netherlands seemingly has whenever a major international tournament comes around. At times, the humour does come rather cheap, making it a story that everyone can write as long as their mind contains a switch for mindless puns and dry humour (and be sure to know what self-mockery is!)
After buying this book for Bryson's fascinating way of writing, I came to the conclusion that "A Short History of Nearly Everything" can teach the average reader so much more than just a witty, fluent and easy-going way of writing. This so-called 'rough guide to science' shows just how much we as a species are a collective of numbskulls, and how we and our fellow Earthlings, Earth, and universe came to be, according to science. Both an entertaining and informative read, this book is a new top tip for anyone who needs a suggestion on what to read next.
The fourth installment of Martin's epic clearly sets things up for things to come, even though he leaves various parts of the overall Song of Ice and Fire untouched for the majority of A Feast for Crows. Setting up the first half of the foundation on which the culmination of the Song will be sung, Martin has successfully managed a new set of intriguing players of the Game of Thrones, while other pieces meet their match and, as is Martin's custom, their well-wrought (and sometimes, deserved) end. This book makes me wonder what will happen to the 'new' settings that are Oldtown, Riverrun, all of the Iron Islands and Dorne, while there is so much more going on in King's Landing, The Wall and across the Narrow Sea we do not know... Yet.
Very interesting science fiction tale from a corner of the world I usually don't read something from. The book gives some light philosophical questions to ponder over and sets the scene for something that can only become greater in the second and third books. Liu Cixin is good at world-building, but almost slows down the narrative too much in the attempts to build the Trisolarian history in particular. Overall, the story is gripping enough that characters remain interesting and engages the reader to want to know more about what comes next, and also throws in some physics that never gets too complicated to follow for non-physicists. This is a very decent start to a trilogy.
This collection of short stories is quite fun, but not all the stories are equally strong. Little mischievous plot points get you off the scent of what's really going on, with the book's title putting right on the nose that that is EXACTLY what is happening. This in itself threw me off my enjoyment of the book now and then, as I started to being paranoid about which element of each short story was the red herring, and what wasn't. Some I could distinguish so easily that I could very well skip the tale, while others were so tricky that their ending was almost too far-fetched to think out, making them a little unsuitable to be labeled as detective stories. Although, Conan Doyle did that every now and again, too, so... Overall a decent story collection to read and then pass on again to another reader.
Gods, I love Stephen Fry's knowledge but humble and witty way of explaining, telling, and the use of his massive brain and his soothing voice to retell these ancient stories. The tales itself are not unknown, but almost hearing Fry's voice through these pages makes it even better to read them once again. Mythos also shines light on the more obscure gods (at least to me, but I never had Greek and the mythological history that came with it at school), so learning about the more nuanced and smaller bits of the world and their divine, but oh so humanesque patrons and matrons as well, is great. This book is a great introduction to the vast mythology of the Greeks, and I guess in years to come, people will put this book on par with the ones Fry himself mentions in his afterword as a source of delight and inspiration.
After multiple years of starting, stopping, and resuming reading these tales. If have finally finished reading all the stories Sir Conan Doyle has published on the world's most famous consulting detective. Hard to read multiple stories (especially the longer ones) in quick succession, but the archetypal whodunnits are lovely to read and, if the mind is set on it, solve the crimes alongside Dr. Watson, seeing as he is the audience's foil. Sometimes too improbable a solution, but Holmes himself states that the only remaining explanation, however improbable, must be the truth if it covers all the facts. My main critique lies in that the stories were not in chronological order in relation to Holmes' life. Still, a wonderful book to have in my possession, and to have read it completely is a joy.
At first I thought this to be just another book about just another social reject whose disorder and complete disconnection from society stands in his way of succeeding at life. I was half right. It is about someone whose brilliance stands in the way of those social connections. Success can be measured, and attaining true success seems one of the greatest struggles in life according to Canin's work. After an initial struggle to get involved into the story, Canin links the story very well together, through masterful writing and a multitude of perspectives. Definitely a great read!
A beautiful nugget of a book. A satirical version of the original Carroll story, this frankly hilarious retelling of 'Alice' shows the reader what has been going on in the UK for the past years. Complete with fitting personas, you sure will have a chuckle. You will need to have at least a little knowledge of the news, but then you'll see who is who soon enough.
An easy-to-read parody about a man with a sad story. Actually, more than one character is confronted with their own hardship, even if some of them have brought it upon themselves. Spring roars in full force, even if seems to be more about its counterpart season: Fall.
Some sort of surrealism avant-la-lettre (with it as a style not being formalised until the twenties), this detective tale is first of all what its subtitle describes: a nightmare. Full of unexplainable situations, like being chased but never getting free, chasing but never catching, and a whole humdrum of seemingly paradoxical comparisons. Not entirely clear what G.K. Chesterton meant when writing this, or why the ending turns out the way it is, but when is a dream ever 100% clear? More study could be needed to find more clarity on this book. One thing is for sure: it wasn't a nightmare to read it.
** spoiler alert ** Apparel makes the man? This is a lovely little novel about a hat. This curious garment influences the wearer's life, and goes on a life-altering spree when it changes hands from its original owner, then President of the French Republic, Francois Mitterand. Interestingly, while most lives are changed positively, one temporary owner desperately chases his new-found-and-then-lost-again lucky hat, afraid he will sink back into nothingness without it. The lucky charm for one, the object of desperate obsession for the other: Laurain's story begs the question whether it's OK to blindly put your trust in something seemingly trivial. Especially if the owner himself sees all from behind the scenes.
Raw, sometimes hardly digestible for its uncoated description of the lives and woes of a group of junkies in Edinburgh, sometimes tough to understand due to the way Welsh has written it down. You do get the hang of the specific Scottish accent put to print, eventually. The story turns as sour as the Scottish weather every now and then, against the grayish backdrop of a cloudy, or hazy, point of view. The perspective on the future that these kids lack, brought on by relatives in some cases, as well as the almost apathetic manner the HIV situations are described, makes Trainspotting depressing at times. The way Welsh has managed to convey this on paper is convincingly well done. A dreary, but masterful book.
[Original score 2.5/5] Picked up at random in the library, I was intrigued by a tale about the Great London Fire. However, it turned out that the tragedy of 1666 is used as a backdrop for what is really happening in this book: a sort-of whodunnit with some historical fiction elements, of which many do not really serve a proper purpose other than to give the tale a little more royal grandeur (hard to take the intruder in the final reveal scene seriously) Granted, I was not aware of Taylor's status as a crime writer, so that makes for an additional half star, as it is a crime story after all rather than a historical novel. Easy read, and kind of makes me interested in the following books in what apparently is a series, but only if I do not want to bend my mind over who did what in what manner for what reason. Vacation stuff, really.
Funny book, written by a funny man and a good actor. Sometimes I heard his voice a little through the pages, but it didn't impair the enjoyment of the book at all.Down-on-his-luck Thomas Lang chooses the right thing (or fails to choose the wrong thing), and gets himself and others in all sorts of bother. Aiming to foil a certain assassination, he becomes the unwilling, but sort-of-plotting cog in a bigger game. Over-analysing (and explaining to the reader what associative thoughts arise during this process) he takes you on a journey of intrigue, fake-out assassination (attempts) and the selling of guns.
This book may seem like a shard of dystopian fantasy, but comes dangerously close to contemporary views on the world of today and tomorrow. Where truth may be made malleable, history may be devaluated and where everyone is programmed to be happy with their 'To each their own', predetermined place in society, the core of humanity may be lost to us. Try to look through our own 'brave new world' through Huxley's eyes, and see for yourself.
This is a very rough book, one I to be honest may better not have read in this dreary season of headspace and weather. The style makes you feel the misery, and sometimes the absence of feeling anything at all, of the characters quite convincingly. Days in the lives of a Scottish family, ranging from Grandma Campbell to titular Shuggie (Hugh Jr.) Bain, the book shows the motions through which the various family members go in their lives in 1980s Glasgow. What seems OK on the surface is marred by the grit of alcoholism, depression, and the very present sense of the inability to escape various things. In a city that is already grey-ish by nature, references to the former industrial age and its decline stain the narrative with not the most positive of outlooks. In this, Shuggie needs to navigate. He subjects himself (subconsciously, perhaps) to his fate, attached to his alcoholic mom in such a way that his elder siblings have long since left, he can only react to situations within his control. Other things just seem to happen to him. Finding one's own identity in a life like that is understandably hard, but their environment does not allow for the slightest possibility of living outside the box you were given. You are an outsider in Pithead, and you stay one, despite most of its residents being able to leave. The ones that do go away, far away, to escape its vice grip. At times really sad, sometimes numbing, I wanted to distance myself from the book multiple times, but could not. It's that good at hooking you back in. The only gripe I could have is the titular character's POV, which seems to be beyond his (especially) childhood years. But then again, maybe you get wise beyond your years in an environment like his.
And that's the third. The Game goes into its next, darker phase: on all sides of the boards, players move their pieces, lose their pieces, lose even more than that. The stakes have never been higher, but who will prevail when a darkness more terrifying than the forces at King's Landing, Winterfell, the Twins and Sunspear combined lures beyond the Wall? The story of Westeros continues, and George R.R. Martin really seems to have tapped into his greater literary abilities here. His descriptive way of writing, showing while not telling, and a feel for rhythm and style that many fantasy novels haven't been able to hit so far, make this third installment in the A Song of Ice and Fire series better than its two predecessors. It's a fat book, but it turns like a Grey Wind.

Interesting book, very original, but could have been 100 pages shorter.
The reason this novel does not get 5 stars, is that the characters are not always completely convincing, and that the plot is sometimes a bit too complicated. That being said, it was a pleasure to read, highly original and very entertaining.
Original story, well-written. Interesting to see the world through the eyes of a fox.
Downton abbey. Love. Costumes. England. London. Dukes and Duchesses. And Sisters.
A bit about feminism and of course love. A difficult love of a governess and her employer.
Beautiful written. Beautiful story about love and cancer. It made me cry.
I love John Green and this was the first book I read. And I totally fell in love with it. About being in love when you are a teenager, drinking, smoking, school and competing.
AMAZING. So funny and you can recognize yourself in her.
One word: Beautiful.
very chicklity. Like it very much. about love and missing family.
If you haven't read this series you missed something! I love this serie sooooo much. It's about magic and about growing up but also about love and coping without your loved ones. And to survive with the presure of death.
I really loved this book! I really liked Gwendolyn and Gideon. Also you learn a lot from it about history and about love through time.
A beautiful novel about a difficult love. You fall in love with Noa and Allie and you would love to have a love story like them. I cried several times during reading the book (and movie). But it is not only about love but it is also about dementia and the pain of not being recognised by your lover.
I must say, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change" by Stephen Covey is quite the read! I found the book to be filled with valuable insights and practical lessons that really made me ponder on how I approach both my personal and professional life, particularly when it comes to how I interact with others.Covey's book lays out seven habits that he believes are essential for personal and professional success. The first three habits focus on developing self-awareness and taking responsibility for one's own life, while the remaining habits concentrate on building positive relationships with others and working effectively in teams.One aspect of the book that I found particularly fetching was the numerous real-life examples that Covey uses to illustrate his points. These examples help the reader to better understand and apply the concepts to their own life. Furthermore, the book is peppered with practical exercises that the reader can use to apply the concepts to their own life, which I found to be quite jolly good!However, towards the end of the book, I must confess, I did find some repetition of core ideas and examples, which made for a slightly tedious read. Nevertheless, the book's overall value far outweighed this minor issue.In conclusion, I would highly recommend "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" to any chaps or lasses looking to enhance their personal and professional effectiveness. The book is packed to the brim with useful insights and thought-provoking ideas that are sure to inspire readers to take positive steps towards personal growth and success.
“In the face of death, life was more attractive”(A quote that hit me in the face)Nora is caught in a world between life and death. The midnight library. The books there contain fragments of her life. Choices she made, regrets she had. Now she can choose to open any book, where her choices have a different outcome. At the start of the book i was thinking to myself “dear where is this going” but it doesn’t take long to get to the interesting parts. In the middle of the book i wondered if it was more of a self-help book than a story book, but after finishing it, it’s more like a really interesting way to look at life. I missed the super thrilling parts i enjoy a lot in other books, but even without it this was an amazing read.
This book ruined me completely. I was crying tears for like the whole last 30 pages. I loved but really hated this book manThe end was perfect though
So many different things thrown together, big part of the book was just me figuring out who was what and what the terms meant that were used
The character development and the world building is everything
This book is a masterpiece.
** spoiler alert ** Emmet is a binder’s apprentice and his job is to bind people’s memories into books. But, these memories only exist in the book. Whatever has been bound is forgotten. One day, Emmet finds a book with his name on it. The book is divided into three parts. The fist part, where we get to know about Emmet’s life. The second part, where we learn about Emmet’s life a few years earlier. The third part, where we read about Lucian. The book is well-written and while reading it gets you into that kind of reading-flow (you know? Lol)The environment is very well described. The problem with this is the absolute horror you picture in your mind on some pages. Super thrilling, and i absolutely loved it. Here comes the spoiler:Ps: Nell didn’t deserve to die
** spoiler alert ** Really liked the way this was written, I rather enjoy short chapters. For a first ‘horror’ book this book was literally perfect. A creepy page turner, not too many huge jump-scares. Loved the way things were described, i hate getting lost in too many details. I feel like Rolf, who is an interesting character, didn’t get enough attention. Spoilers ahead: One thing that really bothers me is the end? Like, where are all the answers? I would’ve liked to see how it ends with Rolf’s sister. Instead I read 288 pages just to be left with no answers. Usually I vibe with open endings but on the back of the cover it literally says that they get winded up in the history of their neighbour, but all i know of him is that he lives there and had a brother and a sister who both died (I’m not even sure that the sister actually died). They probably barely scratched the surface of whatever is causing all those scary thingies in and around the house
this book started rlly great and then it got super weird. I hated it.
Antietam, is another solid Civil War book by James McPherson, and each new book I learn more about the conflict. Definitely recommend this book, with one small note: the book spends a lot of pages on the context of the battle (military developments, aftermath, political consequences) and only thirty-odd pages (or one-fifth of the book) about the battle itself.
This is a kids' book, I admit, but I very much enjoyed the pacing and the adventures, which very much lay in the realm of wonder and less in suspense. The story revolves around three kids, two of whom love to read and one, Kit, who doesn't; she very much prefers to muddy her feet in places like cemeteries. Then, suddenly, when the three of them go to a library (Kit merely trods along because her friends promised that afterwards they'd go to her favorite place), Kit discovers she's actually a teenage wizard. And so the story begins. The book is very much inspired by Harry Potter, not only in the fact of three main characters of which the least knowledgeable is the most important, but also by continued references in the book to a series about one Danny Fandango (e.g. on page 6: "Kit hadn't read any of the Danny Fandango books [...] But fom what Kit had picked up from her friends, Lara was Danny's sister and she was better at magic, but he was the Chosen One, so got to do all the fun stuff." --- Hermione, anyone?). This, however, hardly bothered me, as it feels like the book doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and is very self-aware. (Cf. page 100: "'... like a book, it contains whole worlds, not just the narrow distance between the covers.' 'You could have just said "it's bigger on the inside",' said Kit. 'That's someone else's line,' said Faith." --- a clear reference to Doctor Who and his TARDIS.) It's a fun, light read, and the illustrations are lovely, often gorgeous. Definitely recommend it to younger readers, and even to older ones who are looking for a book to read on the subway.
This was the second time I read this book, because I couldn't quite remember which arguments this book brought forward and which issues it addressed. And having re-read it, I understand quite well why. Kennedy simply doesn't make a particularly coherent case. Much of the book is anecdotal, examples of the (mis-/ab-)use of the N-word throughout much of history and in society these days, and he offers some pros, cons, and nuances so often, that they get mixed in what it is he wants to say, exactly. The book is divided into three main chapters. The first is, in short, about all sorts of different ways that the N-word can be used: “As we have seen, nigger can mean many different things, depenging upon, among other variables, intonation, the location of the interaction, and the relationship between the speaker and those to whom he is speaking.” (p.43) The second chapter deals with all kinds of ways the N-word has been encountered in the American court system: people who sue for being called nigger, attempts to diminish accountability when one has responded violently for being called nigger, people who use the fact that they were called nigger at work to illustrate they work in a hostile work environment, or cases where judges decide whether to admit testimonies containing the N-word. The third chapter is about different ways people have attempted to diminish the use of the N-word in society, cartography, literature, movies, and the like---an area which is probably most relevant to many people living today. "Progress, however, begets new problems, and our subject is no exception," Kennedy writes (p.92). "The very conditions that have helped to stigmatize nigger have also been coducive to the emergence of certain troubling tendencies. Among these latter are unjustified deception, overeagerness to detect insult, the repression of good uses of nigger, and the overly hars puhisment of those who use the N-word imprudently or even wrongly." And he serves up examples of people who have been fired for using the N-word, even if it was in a class discussion about taboo expressions. Or commotion that erupted over the use of a word such as "niggardly," which sounded too much like nigger---even if they are etymologically different. Literature, too, has been scrutinized, and Kennedy uses the example of Mark Twain's work, in which the literal reading of the N-word leads to condemnation, whereas the ironic meaning---in which Twain criticizes the White supremacist stereotypes of Blacks---gets lost. Kennedy uses many examples to illustrate his point, which then also gets drowned by them. And there's a sense of irony, when he states (p.120): "Indeed, some commentators do not even seriously attempt to document their assertions but instead simply note a number of apparently outrageous events and then charge, without substantiation, that these episodes are ... representative." It feels like this is what Kennedy does, too, even if it rarely feels like he's really asserting something. Towards the end, he does take a firmer stance, namely against what he calls eradicationalists: those who want to get rid of the N-word in its entirety, because all uses of the word are harmful and wrong. Their "absolutist position simply fails to acknowledge adequately either the malleability of language or the complexity of African American communities," he states (126). People respond differently to the same phenomenon, after all, because it often is ambiguous. Also, he seems to be of the mind that the N-word should be used more frequently, so as to make it lose its destructive capacities. And the meaning of words can be flipped, as it has among many blacks. I don't know what to think of the book. It's interesting, a quick read, even if the constant hammering of the N-word can numb the reader, especially because it still is such a strong word. Yet, it isn't quite what I needed from the book. It doesn't make a strong case, it doesn't have well-rounded arguments. It mostly relays experiences, and though educational, it felt rudderless at times when I could have used some direction.
Some solid essays, some excellent ones ("Lincoln's Legacy for our Time" comes to mind); others give the impression of being rather extensive book reviews. All in all, as is generally the case in collections of essays about the Civil War, the book (sub)title's a misnomer. The essays are interesting, but they're rarely ever about the current relevancy of the Civil War (with the exception, perhaps, of the essay about Lincoln's Legacy, but that too is more about the international importance and consequences than relevance through time). In the end, it's a good book, with a variety of topics throughout the essays. Just ignore the subtitle.
On the first few pages, the author explains how the rest of the book is the result of a quest for truth and should, for the reader, be something of a companion. The truth may not always be liked, but he advises us to keep our minds open. What becomes clear throughout the book, however, is the premeditation and preconception of Von Wodtke. He too easily dismisses science, too readily accepts the supernatural and paranormal, and subsequently uses the latter to criticize and ridicule the former.In the midst of things, he even takes a political detour, going on about how bad welfare is (because it incites fraud and takes away peoples' opportunities and incentives for self-improvement), and ad nauseum rambles on about "the mainstream media and academia" who are self-righteously "anointed" in their quest for "cosmic justice." He then elaborates seemingly endless, without no foundation other than the readings of a paranormal named Cayce, on the merits of belief in god (increases happiness and the morality of society), the bible, and teachings of "traditional religion."It is all a load of crock. This may seem like an empty, senseless phrase, but there simply are no arguments in the book to dissect and demolish. The guy simply assumes the truth of "traditional religion" and uses it to prove his point, namely that the truth lies with believing in god. First he raises the false premise that science proves religion obsolete, then he demolishes it by saying religious people are healthier and happier. Science can only disprove assumptions made in the past, about the nature of things. In addition, science oftentimes disprove earlier results of science. Von Wodtke states "To me, God exists, and therefore there can be no proof of his nonexistence" (p.263), which basically says it all--especially the truth value of his search for truth.Please, don't read this book, it wasted too much time already.
One would come away from this very readable book with the idea that Longstreet was a douchebag and that Lee could do not wrong, other than trust his generals to do a decent job. J.E.B. Stuart failed Robert E. Lee; A.P. Hill failed him, as did Ewell and a bunch of other generals. But Longstreet singlehandedly made sure Gettysburg was a disaster, if Dowdey is to be believed. I am not sure he is to be believed (he acknowledges that in their love for Lee, fellow generals maligned "Old Pete" after Gettysburg, but goes on to state that no good reputation can be discovered anyhow), I'm sure to read up on Gettysburg and Longstreet in the nearby future.
Lee's Tarnished Lieutenant is a vindication of James Longstreet, the general who has, since 1872, born the blame of losing the battle of Gettysburg and consequently the War Between the States. Piston first lays out Longstreets accomplishments and errors throughout the Civil War, then elaborates on the postwar years, where Longstreet called for cooperation with the Republican Party (which he got ostracized for) and the development of a Lee-Cult following Lee's death in 1870. Jubal Early is the major figure in praising Lee as saintly, and in need of a scapegoat (or Judas) for the disaster at Gettysburg, he finds the traitorous (because Republican) Longstreet. Early and friends produce article after article for the Southern Historical Society Papers and eventually, helped with erroneous and arrogant rebuttals by Longstreet, the image of Longstreet as headstrong, taciturn, sluggish, solidifies into more than popular culture---it ends up in history books.Longstreet was Lee's best general, however: his confidant, his War Horse; and at Gettysburg he did what he was told: he took the offensive, even if he wanted to leave and seek out a stronger, defensive position (such as the one which had proved impenetrable at Fredericksburg). Early's suggestion that Lee desired an attack at dawn, which would have surprized and crushed the Yankees, was a key component of the argument against Longstreet. Such an attack hadn't been ordered and was quite logically impossible. Compare the six-mile march Longstreet's divisions had to make to Jackson's 12-mile, 8-hour march at Chancellorsville, for reference. Had Lee ordered an attack at dawn, Longstreet's troops would have had to march four hours through unreconnoitered terrain, and attack in exhaustion.In short, this book portrays Longstreet as a general who certainly had his share of flaws, but the way he has been vilified on the altar of Lee deification (Leeification?) has been as pernicious as it has been tenacious.
Nice enough read. The premise appealed to my love for (popular) science and travel writing, but failed to deliver fully on either of these genres. Much to my dismay, The Natural History of Dragons does not refer to the contents of this volume, but rather to a book discussed several times in this story. The story, basically a tale of wonder and mystery, is set in a Victorian Fantasy world, which has its charmes, but sometimes leaves the reader wondering why the author didn't simply add dragons to the Victorian world, instead of going through the trouble of making up British or Eastern European sounding names and politics for fictional countries. It distracts from the main idea: there is a Natural History of Dragons to be discovered!
Great insight into the world of manic-depression, from the viewpoint of a Doctor of Psychology and patient, Kay Redfield Jamison. Well written and very insightful, a must-read for everyone interested in Bipolar disorder.
Charles P. Roland's book Reflections on Lee: a Historian's Assessment is a nice read. It tries to be a balanced approach and analysis of Robert E. Lee's qualifications both as a general and as a gentleman, for instance by attempting to countering the criticisms about Lee's generalship. He does a nice job, but oftentimes stretches thin doing so. Albert Sidney Johnston's plan to concentrate his troops for a counterattack against Grant was Lee's, even if Johnston had already put this plan into work. (Conveniently, Lee's absence on the Western theater absolves him of the failure to implement the plan succesfully.) In the end, the reader gets the impression this isn't an honest estimation of Lee, but another hagiography. Take, for example, the following sentence: "Asked pointedly whether he believed blacks were as capable as whites of acquiring knowledge, [Lee] expressed the opinion that they were not, but he added that some were more apt than others. He also protested that he was not particularly qualified to answer such questions." (p.111) My immediate response was, to wonder why not. Roland just spent a few pages elaborating on Lee's "zeal for education" (p.106) at his new job: president of Washington College. As a former slave owner, furthermore, he was surrounded by specimens of both races, and as such familiar with estimating whether "blacks were as capable as whites of acquiring knowledge." Roland, however, dimisses Lee's racism and implicitly sees Lee's protestation as a sign of dishonest questioning. My final thought on this book is, that it's a nice, slim volume to read in order to put the likes of McKenzie and Nolan into perspective. But it does not render their analyses and criticisms of Lee obsolete.
This is not a book about the Appalachian region, in the sense of a sociological exploration or a funny travel memoir or anything hinting in that direction. I start off with that disclaimer, because that's what I though it was when I picked it up. Instead, it's a collection of personal stories about the author's family and friends, his youth, their lives and deaths. Some stories were pretty funny, others were beautifully poetic, and those were the ones that kept me reading and wanting more; but many of the other chapters frankly felt bland in contrast. Let's just say that not all aunts and uncles have the ability to bestow life's wisdom onto their nephews and vicariously onto us. The final chapter, about his return to the region and his observation that, basically, nothing changed, was moving. And his appendix, in which he explains how he merged people and stories of his past, was perhaps one of the most satisfying bits of the book. I just wish there had been more of those last two chapters.Give it a try if you love lore, well-written lore, but pass on this if you're looking for clarity and insight on what's known as the Appelachian region.
"My enemy, My brother" narrates the battle of Gettysburg as seen through the eyes of people who were there. Because of the switching POVs it sometimes got a little confusing, but it was a very readable as it was written like fiction, but based largely on memoirs and diaries.
This little book entered my life in a sudden urge to read books about books. Although it seems a diversion from my usual path of non-fiction books, it really isn’t, as 84 Charing Cross Road is based on (or the literal portrayal of) the actual correspondence of Helene Hanff with Frank Doel, the salesman from the bookstore Marks & Co. Hanff, New Yorker, keeps ordering books at the store based in London, and does so for 20 years, meanwhile accumulating a correspondence, mainly with Doel. It makes for a charming book, but leaves the reader unsatisfied nonetheless. If they did write back and forth irregularly for a period of twenty years, one hardly notices a blooming of some sort of friendship. Little actually passes between miss Hanff and Frank Doel, the salesperson, and letters contain, the occasional joke aside, mostly business. She loves to order books and he kindly replies, inserting personal information only hesitantly, now and then.It is a constant delay of excitement, of things actually happening; every letter takes the shape of a cliffhanger to herald things not to come. The book, withering in potential, is much more waiting to happen than actually there. To my surprise, the bulk of my pocketbook version is not the story itself, but the diary-like entries of miss Hanff when she finally visited London in 1971. Which is interesting for a while, but after 50 odd pages of mesmerizing by a tourist at loss one wonders about the entertainment level of it all. We know she gets offers for interviews and dinners (which she gladly accepts, for she has no money to spend on fancy restaurants); we know she’s never been to England and loves to discover the little known of London. After a while, it just gets old and one struggles through the mud of page after page, finally to reach the little gem where she quotes Prospero and admits that it all seems less than real once she gets on the plane. Once again she’ll be across the ocean from the fantasy world she indulged in for over 20 years, dreaming of the bookstore at 84 Charing Cross Road she never got to see, because they closed shortly after she stopped writing.
"In search of nice Americans: Off the grid, on the road and State to State in Trump's America" is a misnomer. First of all, this trip was undertaken in August of 2016, when Trump hadn't been elected. If anything, this was still Obama's America. Second, when author Geoff Steward (who keeps insisting Americans mistake is last name for his first name, but also that he keeps meeting Americans named Jeff Stewart) writes that "I did find some nice Americans" and that "most of them are nice" he does so on page 295 (of 298). In fact, if it were up to me, I'd have called this book "Me and my snarky sojourns into Obama's America," because he neither seems to try to meet nice Americans, nor does he seem to like any of the ones he does meet. The closest thing to any search for nice Americans seems to be his failed attempt to locate Tom Hanks's star on Hollywood Boulevard (p.200), and when on the same page he writes "LA is keen to strike a pose, but doesn't want to get to know you," I can't help but find it ironic. We're two-thirds in, and all this Brit writes about is his job and family (in fact, pages 1 to 60 are about British litigation and descriptions of every one of his kids) and how he wishes half of the people he encounters would die a slow and painful death, without any attempt to really get to know some (nice) Americans. On page 220 he writes "she is such an enthusiastic fan of the Grand Ole Opry, that it is hard not to adopt her," and it's the first nice thing he has said about any American in the book. "That's what I love about Nashville," he writes (p.221) "everyone is so warm and welcoming," yet much of what he writes about the city is some snide remarks about street evangelists. He seriously seems to have written something different in his mind than what I've been reading, for in his acknowledgements he looks back on "...the affectionate portrayal of everyday American people contained in these pages ..." (p.301), Only on page 297 do we get a glimpse of what kindness has transpired during his vacation: "what I will miss most is The Wilderness Adventurer ... for the nice Americans we met, the stories they told and, simply put, the sense of belonging and community." Well, that's what I missed most as well, because none of these affections can be found in the heap of sarcasm that is this book. Where there is love for Nashville and its music, there is exultation in Savannah. And finally does he let up, finally do I read what I wished the entire book would be.His facade of sarcasm subsides for much of the pages he uses to describe this leg of the trip. But it's page 229 by then, and it simply seems too little too late, all too quick to vaporize before the ego that is Geoff Stewart. A three-page description (251 to 254) of his home county of Clevelend (England) is followed by the sentence "I am thinking all this as I drive past Cleveland, North Carolina." And then he meets his second nice American: an Indian who likes England. Go figure. From page 259 onwards, it's 30-odd pages of vacationing in Costa Rica. Which even in 2017, when the book was printed, wasn't part of "Trump's America," so a short calculation will lead to the conclusion that a full third of this book has not been anywhere near America or Americans. Frankly, I was disappointed by this book, not because it wasn't funny (I guess it was for large parts), but because it didn't own up to its promise. It wasn't about America, nor wasn't it about meeting nice Americans. And I wanted to read the book that was promised, not the one that I bought.
This book had a lot of potential, apparently aiming to be a modern amalgam of all sorts of fantasy franchises. The protagonist - Dr. Addie Cox - is a literary nerd, with love for the magical genre, from Harry Potter, through the Neverending Story, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia to Labyrinth, but also ancient lore and Sphinx' riddles. As is her ex of five years, who just so happened to have designed and implemented a large part of the Insula Mirabilis - a magical island where all fantastical families are thrown together into what will be some sort of Nerdy amusement park. Except, there has been a mutiny and now a group of Marines and Dr. Cox are sent in to quell this rebellion. What ensues is a story along all aforementioned elements, which would seem enough to make nerds water at the mouth. But the story's so uneven, part fantasy, part detective, part chick-lit in the worst way (with a continuously stumbling, fumbling, faltering protagonist, to off-set the disciplined and well-trained marines) that it didn't feel balanced to do any of the genres justice. It's never immersive enough to want to visit this is "Wonderful Island", never truly suspenseful, and the veneer of distressed damsel doctor felt like a constant itch. The story develops like a brook, only to have it crash down as a waterfall towards an end that felt much different tonally than the rest of the book, and the final resolution felt haphazard, almost anticlimactic after such a sudden surge. To be sure, it tickled my nerdy fances, but left me wanting for more in certain areas, mostly confused in others, and itchy in the third.
This is such a nice read. Admittedly, it is less fun and quirky than its predecessor, "Have Sword, Will Travel," but it feels more mature and like an actual adventure. It has more substance, the characters no longer need to be fleshed out, as we've met them in the previous volume, and so there is much attention to the story. It's still a kid's adventure, to be sure, and the eventual resolution of the conflict felt imbalanced, but the epilogue promises more to come. I, for one, will keep my eyes open for that one.
Buttigieg is currently trying to secure the Democratic Nomination for the Presidential elections of 2020, and I hope he grabs it. He's an intelligent, thoughtful politician, and he's young enough to understand the current generation, but old enough to have experienced the generation before. He's from the mid-western state of Indiana, and has grappled with political opponents enough to know how to work with them. Pete 2020!
The Order of the Phoenix is One of the better Harry Potter books. Of course, there's still the fact that Harry is still a teenager and, as such, he often feels misunderstood by the rest of the world. So much so, that he feels others need not profit from any real kind of communication. Ah, the sweet paradox of puberty. But the book rises above its predecessors in that it presents the reader with a true and present antagonist, instead of a mysterious one which unravels at the end of each volume. The tangible presence of Dolores Umbridge does make one wonder, however, whether she isn't actually a more formidable enemy than Voldemort in what she does and in the threat that she presents to the lives of all Harry---and by extension, we---holds dear. I found I appreciated the development of her character more than that anything about The Dark Lord, who seems so singularly focused that he becomes a rather tedious character. He may know a lot of magic, but he can't be caught saying anything wise or otherwise of interest. Therefore, I found merit in the further development of Potter's life beyond Privet Drive and Hogwarts. There are hospital visits, and celebrations of birthdays at the Order's secret Headquarters. And it makes him and the people around him human and relatable. But also gives them an intrinsic motivation to live, love, laugh. (Which is such a bland statement, it could have been part of one of Voldemort's derisions.) Go and read this one. It's so much better than the movie!
This short volume (at only 103 pages) is a must read for everyone who is interested in why the South seceded from the United States in 1860/1. After the war, many Southern apologists insisted that it was State Rights (the right to do what, exactly?), clashing economies, differing philosophies, etc. But Dew's analysis of the arguments made before the war, by Commissioners sent to convince other Southern states to secede, illustrates perfectly that the main conflict of Southern politicians with the North was slavery. The election of Lincoln prompted the states to secede, because he and his party were viewed as Black Republicans who were bent on abolishing slavery and, worse yet, making the Black American equal in standing to the Whites. This would, the Commissioners were adamant, incite racial unrest and destroy Southern civilization---a civilization that was beneficial to both slave and master, they argued; after all, it was their subservient position in the Christian society that kept them from acting like the Barbaric race that they in actuality were. Their words, not mine."Apostles of Disunion" is required reading for anyone who still believes that the South fought for nought but honor and the defense of their home. For anyone to believe that the War of Northern Agression (sic) had nothing to do with slavery, because the North didn't fight to free slaves, requires ignoring the motivations of the Southerners who chose to secede. After all, they believed that Lincoln was, indeed, motivated by abolitionism, which led to their secession, which in turn led to the Civil War. They sincerely believed that their institution of slavery was in danger. If nothing else, the letter of one of the Commissioners, which is printed in its entirety, makes this abundantly clear.
In his latest and last book, Horwitz goes back to traveling the South and linking it to 19th-century history. As his Confederates in the Attic is one of my all-time favorite books, I could not wait to pick this up and be immersed in the author's observations and connections. And the book truly is insightful and entertaining, but alas it lacks the historical focus and much of the humor and many of the quirks that Confederates had. In Spying on the South, Horwitz chases after Frederick Law Olmsted, who, before gaining fame for developing Central Park in Manhattan, in the 1850s undertook three travels through the South. Olmsted tried to be an objective observer, and wrote three books about his sojourns. To my surprise and disappointment, Horwitz chose to ignore the last of Olmsted's books, which was about the actual South, and focused instead on following, by and large, the rivers out of West Virginia to New Orleans, and then headed for Texas. Why Horwitz opted for the misnomer "Spying on the South" instead of "Going to Texas" (a prevalent theme in 19th-century history) or even Olmsted's own "Journey through Texas" is beyond me, because much of the book is actually about going to and traveling through Texas. Don't get me wrong, the book is interesting and engaging, it's a treasure to be granted more of Horwitz' writing. The book's strength, to me, lies mostly in the historical theme: visiting old sites and comparing them to Olmsted's observations, seeing how things have changed or remained the same; visits to historical re-enactments of The Alamo, Native American Reservations, or Mexican villages all become more fascinating in the light of 150 years of history. One of the highlights is Olmsted's stay in the Texas area where German refugees from the 1848 revolution lived, and Horwitz' elaboration on the anti-slavery society they tried to maintain even through the Civil War. But for all the theme, the book seems to lack a certain focus on exactly that history, and shifts into the America of today, with political views and the election of 2016 looming over Horwitz' encounters. Maybe I'm not being fair, especially by comparing it to my favorite book, but for all the good notes it hit for me, it never struck a chord to make it as dear to me as Confederates.
I half expected this to be a Sanderson version of Harry Potter, but along the way I realized that the magic of HP lies within its casual world-building, not necessarily in its writing or plot. So Sanderson's book reads much more serious and has a better ending. Though not really, because it ends with "to be continued" and there is no part two. Needless to say, I can't wait for there to be a part 2 - and an entire series - to further develop the world and build up the suspense and get to know the characters.
Jeff Shaara' Civil War Battlefields is a pleasure to read, especially as I have visited all the Battlefields Shaara writes about. It could have used a little more about the actual parks themselves in relation to the amount of history, but it generally is a really good book. Very useful for people who are looking into visiting the sites.
Beautiful prose, fast-paced, great insight in the mind of a desperate, depressed adolescent. For those who thinks she's self-indulgent and narcissistic: that's illustrative of the kind of person portrayed in the book. A similar feat was accomplished in the author's next memoir, more, now, again.
I liked part 1, the people; not so much part 2, the investigation; but I absolutely loved part 3, the road trip. John Green creates interesting characters in every book he writes, and includes these idiosyncrasies to make them central to his story. I like him and his books. Definite must-read!
This book appealed to me, because of the front cover: someone pulling a book off amply stacked shelves, while holding another thick volume. I like books about people working with books --- booksellers, librarians, and the like --- probably because I can relate, as I work in a bookstore myself. And there are things in here that I can relate to: passion for books, a certain disdain for the kind of people the protagonist calls "zombies" who scarcely look away from their electronic devices ("I feel like the Maginot Line of public reading," p.56), and the frustration for the monopoly-like position that literature holds in the institution she works at. Even, I guess, the general grumpy mood of the librarian --- after all, I self-deprecatingly refer to myself as a grumposaur.But in the end it felt rather unsatisfactory. The "unrequited love" from the title is not so much a love as more of an obsession for a customer whose only words exchanged with the librarian have been about increasing the lighting. Also, the book has been written as if the librarian addresses the reader, who she has caught staying overnight in the library and who occasionally asks questions that I didn't feel like asking. The experience was therefore alienating. Add to this the fact that I felt the protagonist praised the Dewey Decimal Classification of books at first, only to denounce it altogether as hellish in the end. Never does the protagonist become charming and someone to empathize with; she starts off as peevish and ends up as downright irate. "What kind of literature is going to be produced in a society where there are no wars of epidemics or revolutions? I'll tell you what: badly written novels about nice girls and boys falling in love, who make each other suffer without meaning to ..." p.51.Although I found this either ironic or quaintly self-reflective, I am still not sure if it truly applies. Is this book badly written? Not really. Is it about nice girls? No. About falling in love? In a sense, yes, even if the obsession is more stalkerish than romantic in nature. Is it about unintentional suffering? Very much so, the protagonist agonizes over the subject of her desire, and his ignorance indicates lack of intention. So, there we have it. My verdict about this novelette is an unbalanced: Meh.
The Road came highly recommended. But it was a tedious tale about a father and son trudging through a dystopian America. Everything is dead and gray and ashen, I get it. And there are bad people around, but never are they truly in danger. Encounters are short and easily dealt with. There is no context on the how or why behind the dystopia, it simply is. And that just doesn't cut it for me.
This book was, to put it succinctly, underwhelming. This is due, of course, to the fact that I watched the Netflix series, which delved into all the issues described in the book, but deeper. The series added drama and intrigue, whereas the book in contrast felt meek. It's a good book, worth reading apart from the series. Many characters felt a little cardboard and one dimensional, but this makes sense because the story's told by someone who felt hurt by those people, and specific things they did, moreover. It's simply the tale of one who was so hurt that she chose her way out, and the thirteen reasons why she did just that. Very moving, even if the visualization of the series added to the emotional power.
James "Old Pete" Longstreet has been vilified since the Civil war, and blamed for losing the battle of Gettysburg because of obstinacy and intentional tardiness of day 2 and 3 of that battle. It was said he argued with Lee and couldn't stand the fact that his superior would not budge, and therefore took to sabotaging wherever he was able during the fight. Pfarr robustly vindicates Longstreet, by detailing all the controversies that have since arisen and illustrating that Longstreet did not, in fact, sulk and sabotage; that much of the responsibility of any of the failures during the early July days of 1863 indeed lay elsewhere. Longstreet was not averse to doing battle, but very much preferred "offensive strategy, and defensive tactics." That is: take the army up north, then force the enemy to attack you when you're well entrenched on the ground of your own choosing. Lee opted, instead, to go for offensive tactics (attack the Federals who occupied the high ground), and the ultimate blame for losing Gettysburg lies with him.Pfarr's opinionated reasoning may rub some readers the wrong way, but his arguments are largely historiographical and are bound to go against what has long been said about Longstreet's actions. And his arguments are solid, his use of primary material excellent and refreshing. He often relies on words written by people who were present at different stages of the campaign, in order to dismantle the Lost Cause rhetoric that has been raging against Longstreet for much since the death of Robert E. Lee in 1870, and that has since influenced many historians.This is a slim volume, but it sure packs a punch, and is rather detailed in its analysis. I very much recommend it, for anyone who wants to better understand what happened during the fateful July days in 1863.
A worthy successor to the first part of Lady Trent's memoirs, which clearly displays the author's affinity with anthropology.
To be honest, I kept putting off reading this one, because everyone kept emphasizing it was written as a play and therefore would be a troublesome read of some sorts. Well, it turned out it wasn't at all. I flew through the book like a Death Eater through the Hogwarts halls.In a large sense, this is a much requested and much desired sequel to the Harry Potter series. We meet the same characters, only a generation older, as they send their kids off to their Alma Mater. This necessarily brings back good memories of mischief and adventures of the old books. It even conjures up and revives affection those we did not like very much or very long in the old books.And yet the whole feels more like a pitch for a book than a fully fleshed out story. This could very well be because it is a play which needs to be acted out on stage, I am well aware of that, but we barely get a chance to get to know the new characters in a sequence of flash scenes: we see the kids sent off to their first year at Hogwarts, then their second, and their third. As if entire years in school are uneventful and have to be skipped to the good part: the Possibility of another Dark Enemy.Some elements are given more attention than others, and it is here that the story illustrates the simmering, latent potential behind this rather skeletal plot. And on the other hand, it is quite obvious that Rowling appears to need a singular, powerful opponent, that can nevertheless be beaten by moderately skilled (child) wizards (cf. Fantastic Beasts), and I am not sure this is something that would turn out as successful as the Harry Potter series (quality-wise, I mean, as I am sure Potterheads devour anything HP-related).I loved some details in this book (the love between people), was put off by others (the constant talk of love between people), but generally liked it enough for what it is: a play, a gift to the fans, a hint at what might have been and what would become of some people. I just wish it could have been a proper book, is all.
This is a pleasant memoir about how Dee Williams grew to want, then built, then lived in a tiny house. Her main motivation is reconnection to nature, life, to people around her, and she does it by letting go of stuff, but mainly by letting go of the burdens of debt and costs of living. The book is a lot of ruminating, which sometimes resonated with me and at other times alienated me from the author, but that's fine. Our motivations in life aren't all the same, even if we share interests. Williams asks a few rhetorical questions toward the end of the book (p.283), one of which is: "Whose idea was it that we should all get jobs, work faster, work better, race from place to place with our brains stewing on tweets, blogs, and sounds bites, on must-see movies, must-do experiences, must-have gadgets, when in the end, all any of us will have is our simple beating heart, reaching up for the connection to whoever might be in the room or leaning into our mattress as we draw our last breath." (A sentence uncharacteristic of the book, don't worry.) It echoes strongly as a modern version of Henry David Thoreau's sentiment in Walden, as he writes about economy: we have, in modern life, started working more for luxuries and distractions than for the necessities. These luxuries and distractions then grow to be burdens in life, instead of improvements.He writes, for instance: "... there is an illusion about 'modern improvements'; there is not always a positive advance. The devil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his early share and numerous succeeding investments in them. Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end ..."And it makes me wonder, whether I should be reading Walden next. See if it holds up, or maybe improves upon The Big Tiny. We'll see.
The latest re-read of this, one of my favorite books, coincided with digging up the diaries of my 15-16-year-old self. And it is obvious where my love for The Perks comes from: my own deep yearning for connection at that age, and the desperation that grew when those few friends I had were away on holiday or otherwise absent. I, too, wrote letters in order to gather my thoughts and solidify the sometimes etherial. Both the movie and the book hit me "right in the feels"; they move me to a large extent because I sympathize en commiserate. It's why I keep coming back to both formats of the story: to be touched, to experience a bittersweet melancholy, and to confront myself with the perennial paradox inside myself---that I carry both a deep need for connection and, to a large extent, the inability to maintain such connections.
Warning: this is not at all a "guide," let alone to "celebrating your true self." The writing was all over the place, lacked coherency and depth. It was full of unrelatable anectodes, empty, unexplained references to enneagram types and a tedious, uninformative part about the Briggs-Meyers Type Indicator. Extraverted preferences are always worded negatively, as if extraverts are a bit silly.And there are quizzes in there, that are idiotic and redundant. Don't believe me? Here are some (typical!) questions: True or False?- Introverted adolescents thrive in large groups, especially when they are put on the spot and asked 'embarrassing' questions (false)- Introverts always feel relaxed on dates (false)- Raising adolescents is like nailing jell-o to a tree (true)- People might have trouble being creative if they're too obsessed with themselves (true)- It's good to paint, draw or make up cartoons--even if the result is kind of silly (true)Speaking of silly cartoons: the book is filled with nonsensical cartoons that do little more than distract from the topic. The book is written as if to cater to teens or pre-teens, but then there are parts about how to raise introverted kids. So, also in that respect it seemed to lack focus or a clear goal.Still want to read the book? Go ahead. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
This was increasingly painful to read, with every next chapter. They misrepresent every opposing stance and thus break one of their sacred commandments: "thou shalt not bear false witness."
This book was resting on my shelf, and I half forgotten that it was, when I picked it up to read alongside Louisa May Alcott's Little Women. After all, the titular March is the father who's conspicuously absent from the little women's lives. The work indeed serves to fill the void that was left by Louisa May Alcott: “Alcott's story is concerned with the way a year lived at the edge of war has worked changes in the characters of the little women, but what war has done to March himself is left unstated,” Brooks writes in her afterword (275). Or, as the story itself ends with reference to the father's homecoming in Little Women: “All eyes were on [Beth] then, before anyone had thought to ask their father how a year at war had changed him” (273). It is one of the reasons this novel appealed to me so. Brooks's novel certainly has things going for it. It's largely based on the life of Louisa's father Amos Bronson Alcott, and does a good job in portrarying him with all his ideals, impractical and contrary they may be in different situations (anti-slavery in the army, vegetarianism in a Southern household that serves meat, teaching slaves when it is illegal to do so). It makes for a fascinating character study. Not only does the novel aim to fill a void, it is also a juxtaposition of the kindly lives the March girls lead in a Nothern town and the harsh lives of the soldiers in the field. Whereas the girls battle boredom in their week off (chapter XI, “Experiments”), March is getting shot at, sees a fellow soldier drown in panic, observes how slaves are killed or maimed for his sake. Eventually he makes it to a hospital in extremely weakened condition, only to be fed calomel (a mercury chloride compound) as a medicine, and be surrounded by men dying of illnesses and amputations. The Civil War isn't on the fringe of this story, as it is in Little Women, it is front and center.The contrast this book wishes to offer, does not always succeed. Those who are familiar with Little Women, raise an eyebrow when Mrs March ponders how, when she told “the girls we had no right to complain, when we each of us had merely done our duty and will surely be happier for it in the end. They were hollow words then and all the more so now” (209). After all, the March family, as the Alcotts, always were in search of improving themselves, aiming to be better, if not good, people. In her afterword, Brooks explains that her mom once told her “Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee” (280), which led to her altering the character of Mrs March so. If Alcott's “real family far less perfect” than the March family in the book (ibid), women and family often truly felt the sense of duty to the country. Boys went off to war because they genuinely felt it; so why would Brooks feel the need to insert a faux motivation in Marmee? If Bronson's life inspired much of the story, parts of the narrative felt contrived as to stretch plausibility. March teaching a slave to read mirrors Bronson Alcott's integrated classroom, but there was absolutely no need to insert a love story in the narrative. It did absolutely nothing for the plot and only served to alienate characters from their portrayal in Little Women and their real life counterparts. All in all, this book made me curious to read more about the Alcotts: see what real life ordeals they went through, and what trials the Civil War had in store for them. Obviously, Bronson Alcott, aged 61, did not join the army as a chaplain; instead, it was Louisa who served as a nurse and came home with calomel poisoning. Beyond this, I am sure there is much more to be found out, for instance in biographies such as "Eden's Outcasts" and "Marmee and Louisa." They may very well be next on my list.P.S. As an enormous fan of “Confederates in the Attic,” it was a thrill to find out that Ms. Brooks is married to its author, Tony Horwitz. “I would like to apologize for all the times I refused to get our of the car at Antietam or whined about the heat at Gettysburg; for all the complaints about too many shelves colonized by his Civil War tomes and all the moaning over weekend expeditions devoted to events such as the internment of Stonewall Jackson's horse. I'm not sure quite when or where it happend, but on a sunken road somewhere, I finally saw the light” (280). There is hope yet, for all Civil Bores out there.
Ok, so this is a fantasy book for kids, and at times feels rather constrained for that reason. But it's a light read, it's fun and quirky, and will serve as a great introduction for younger readers into the fabulous world of knights and dragons.
This is a charming and somewhat confusing book, exploring the fictional world of the March family, of Little Women fame. In it, the authors imagine Jo's struggle of writing the sequel to her own Little Women, which she loosely based on the life of her own family and friends. In short, it's a book where reality and fiction are so strongly entangled that I started googling facts from Louisa May Alcott's life, in order to see if some of Jo's encounters and sojourns were based on fact. Take, for instance, Charles Dickens's lecture in Steinway Hall that Jo attends. Lu (for Louisa) was, in actuality, an avid fan of Dickens, and she did meet with him. First in London, when she was in London, but also in America when Dickens toured there. Contrary to Jo, Louisa was thoroughly disappointed by Dickens in real life: "Heard Dickens and was disappointed ... the red-faced man, with false teeth, and the voice of a worn-out actor, had his scanty grey hair curled ... there was nothing genuine about him." But in this parallel world of the March family, Dickens doesn't visit New York in the winter and spring of 1867 and 1868, but in the summer of 1869. (The authors do acknowledge this in the historical notes on page 364 and 365.) Truth and fiction seem fluid throughout the book, in which fiction refers to fiction, while being seeped in both the Little Women novel as in the lives of the Alcott family. When Amy addresses how Little Women was about their family, Jo retorts (p.221): "It's not about you, goose. Not the real you. Just the version of you I've invented." "If the character is an invention,"Amy replies, "why couldn't she be named something other than Amy March?" Of course, in real life, Amy March was, indeed, a pseudonym for May Alcott. To add to my confusion is the fact, that I named my late cat after Josephine "Jo" March, and many a time I read the name, because I so often use it to talk to or about my dear cat, it felt as if the protagonist of the story was named after my feline family member, and not the other way around. The entirety felt like a dream state with blurry lines. Of course, there also were some slip-ups by the authors, which emphasized that this work of fiction was written in this day and age, because of anachronisms that seeped into the text. Whether they were references such as "she supposed she would never be considered a real writer now... Never invited to lecture at the Athenaeum with Ralph and Henry..." (p.4), to Henry David Thoreau, who tragically died in 1862, which 1869 Jo certainly would have known. (Of course, this being an alternate timeline, maybe Henry survived past the Civil War.) Or the comical attempt to let Fred Vaughn sound particularly British by calling Laurie "old sport" (216), a British term that was popular some fifty years later but not in 1869. At Meg's wedding, friends and family make sure she is adorned with "something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue." However, this, too, is anachronistic, as the first use of the rhyme started in an English county and its first written reference was made in 1871, or two years after Meg's purportedly real life wedding.About halfway, the authors made some odd choices to pad the runtime of the book. Meg and Amy slowing down the story, by either turning down a proposal or becoming ill. Even if this was "inspired by May's own sad, sudden fate" of an "untimely death at age thirty-nine, eight weeks after childbirth," as the authors explain in their historical note (364), it feels random and uninspired.As "a romantic reteling" (subtitle), relationships are re-imagined and diverted from either their fictional or actual origins. To me, the contrived culmination loses both the elegance and power of reality. It is as if the authors are writing fan-fiction, conforming to the demands of 19th-century letter writers, pleading for Jo to end up with Laurie, which Louisa May Alcott was adamant she would not do, and who herself never actually got married. This isn't art imitating life, it's art imitating art. Suddenly, Jo (still only 19 years old in this world) is merely afraid of loving and losing love -- as if she can't genuinely not be in love, an ending that is perfectly alright. I guess I'm just not much of a romantic.But I enjoyed the book all the same.
I was curious about this book, to see if a woman would experience life as a man differently from her daily life. And she did. Men are treated differently than women; different things are expected of men than of women, which Vincent clearly explains in her final chapter. Along the way, she's spent time as a man in different settings: going bowling, at a strip club, at work, in a monastery, and at a men's support group. The first chapters were rather insightful, as they involved everyday life---sports and dating. The other chapters, however, felt contrived, as Vincent was seeking out situations where men are isolated and among themselves, and extremely so. What conclusions can one draw from men in monasteries? Or what can be said about men's sexuality, after visiting strip clubs for weeks on end? Instead of drawing me in, the chapters started alienating me. I did not recognize much of her experiences as a man. (And part of this was due to the fact that some chapters ended up being more about women---e.g. dating and the strip club.) Even the job she took in sales was supposed to reflect a masculine profession ("Glengarry Glen Ross it," she says), which results in a skewed view on work relations between men. But the final chapter distills her information into a comprehensive conclusion, a sound that I do agree with and that I wish more people would understand (p.272): "... men are ... victims of the patriarchy, too, but (and this will be the hardest part to swallow) that women have been codeterminers in the system, at times as invested and active as men themselves in making and keeping men in their role ... it means that men and women are finally agreeing on something: the system sucks."Vincent's penultimate finding? (p.276) "Somebody is always evaluating your manhood. Whether it's other men, other women, even children. and everybody is always on the lookout for your weakness or your inadequacy ... and that, I leaned very quickly, is the straitjacket of the male role, and one that is no less constrictive than its feminine counterpart. You're not allowed to be a complete human being. Instead you get to be a coached jumble of stoic poses. You get to be what's expected of you." For example (p.277): "[Women] wanted me to be in control, baroquely big and strong both in spirit and in body, but also tender and vulnerable at the same time, subservient to their whims and bunny soft. They wanted someone to lean on and hold on to, to look up to and collapse beside, but someone who knew his reduced place in the postfeminist world nonetheless."In the end, much of the book felt as filler, as ramblings on about women in strip clubs, or women who'd still want to date her after they found out she wasn't a man. If only the rest were as analytically to the point as the concluding chapter, I would have really liked the book.
The story had so much potential, but it took 75 pages to become slightly interesting and only after 200 pages did the book grab me and me not wanting it to let go of me. Which is alright if it's a Russian epic novel of 700 or more pages, but not for this 300 page book to be as great as it could have been.
Much to my regret, this book felt rather unsatisfying. It tries to be a dual biography of Lincoln and Whitman, president and poet, and meanwhile connecting the two lives. Its subtitle is "parallel lives in Washington," and right out of the gate it missed the mark for me. Lincoln, we learn, had a copy of Whitman's Leaves of Grass in the office, and often read in it. Epstein then suggests that Whitman inspired some of Lincoln's writing, which he tries to substantiate with unconvincing quotations. The Civil War brought both men to Washington, DC, where they did not actually meet, but they glanced at one another when Whitman stood on a corner as Lincoln's barouche passed on its way from the White House to the Soldier's Home, north of the city. Their separate lives are elaborated on in alternate chapters. The epilogue, then, is about a speech Whitman held about Lincoln, in April of 1887, on the 22nd anniversary of the assassination. It was moving, Epstein writes, and the crowd was filled with well-known authors, general William Tecumseh Sherman, and John Hay. All in all, this was an odd volume, for it was neither fully about "lives in Washington," nor about Whitman or Lincoln. It was too little of too much to me.
When I picked up this book, it was done out of a kind of voyeurism, but once I started reading I became intrigued: there might actually be a moral to the story, an argument in favor of one-night stands, a celebration of promiscuity and its qualities. It's when Handler writes (13): "Many people feel like a one-night stand is something to be ashamed of or embarrassed by. I disagree. There are many ways to get to know someone, and my personal favorite is seeing them naked in Happy Baby pose. I also feel it is important to have sex soon after meeting someone in order to find out if you have sexual chemistry together. Otherwise, you could wait two to three months after you start dating someone only to discover that your new boyfriend is bad in bed, or even worse, is into anal beads and duct tape."Of course, one can question the sustainability of any relationship where one doesn't communicate about sex before actually, but that's a point I was willing to ignore. Sexual chemistry is important and why not find out early? But this book isn't actually about relationships and sexual chemistry. It's simply about Handler's desire for sex for the sake of sex. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but don't pretend that you want to "get to know someone." Page after pages it's about her getting drunk or doing drugs and her trying to fuck someone successfully or unsuccessfully in this inebriated state. And yes, many of the anecdotes in this book aren't actually about Handler's Horizontal Life or a one-night stand. If it's all meant to be funny, it's not. It's mostly just crass. Whether it's her bromide about a black penis the size of her forearm, or about her getting it on with a midget, I did not chuckle once. In the latter part of the book, Handler seems to come to her senses, without actually confronting or reflecting on her own premise (that one-night stands are a good way to gauge a relationship). She muses, for instance, that, "I had never been left so quickly after sex before, though I had done it many times to others. Now that the shoe was on the other foot, I began to realize what abandonment was all about" (161). But it's all still self-involved and the only one she cares for is herself, as she doesn't actually change her ways, and if she does, it's not out of consideration for the men but for her own desires.That she's stuck in the fun/relationship dichotomy, which directly contradicts her justification for sleeping around in the beginning of the book, is illustrated by her asking rhetorically: "Yes, of course I want to get married, but does that mean I'm not allowed to go out and have a good time? Am I suppose to just marry any schmuck that comes along?" (198) This dichotomy is a false one, as if there is no nuanced position between sleeping around and meeting someone for the rest of your life. In fact, she illustrated this earlier in the book, when she observed that, "This could definitely turn into a relationship. I knew because I didn't want to sleep with him right away, and I've felt that way only a couple of times" (173).Toward the end, she really seems to have had enough of the life she so exploits for laughs in the rest of the book. "The thought occurred to me that the one-night stand was not nearly as much fun as it used to be. I felt disgusted with myself for being so disappointed in a complete stranger not being able to perform. I felt like a man must feel after using and abusing women for ages. [ Notice the casual misandry] ... If I continued on this path, the only men I was going to meet were guys like me, and I definitely don't want to end up with someone like me. The idea of marriage and monogamy were concepts that didn't make me shiver like they once used to" (208). So it was all just a phase of fun and games, which she outgrew in order for her, not to settle but to settle down?This book doesn't know what it wants to be. A celebration of one-night stands and sexual liberation, a justification for sleeping around as a means for gauging chemistry between people, or the observation that it's a fun phase which ultimately serves to look back with regret. So when her friend suggests on the final page (213) that, "You should write a book," she rightly responds: "What a dumb idea." If only she'd listened to herself.
"War and its horrors, and yet I sing and whistle. Oh, my sweetheart, if only this wicked war were over so that we could in peace and quiet tranquilly finish the book of Love which we have but just begun." (p.129)This is such a neat, sweet book, containing the letters Civil War General George Pickett wrote to his fiancée and subsequent wife. He was smitten with her in the worst way, pronouncing his love in every letter, meanwhile writing her about the trials and tribulations of his army life. "Every tramp---tramp---tramp is a thought---thought---thought of my darling, every halt a blessing invoked, every command a loving caress," he sighs (p.90). His affection for his men shines through the words, he relays anecdotes about his fellow officers and the incessant movings on of the troops. Battles are rarely the focal point of his letters, likely because they were written to his wife, but occasionally there are gems such as this one about Fredericksburg: "Your soldier's heart almost stood still as he watches those sons of Erin fearlessly rush to their death. The brilliant assault on Marye's Heights of their Irish Brigade was beyond description. Why, my darling, we forgot they were fighting us, and cheer after cheer at their fearlessness went up all along our lines." (p.66)The part about the Gettysburg is most extensive, as it was the longest period of being away from his fiancée. It is also one of the most interesting, because there is a lot of controversy around the role of James "Old Pete" Longstreet at that battle. "Pickett, I am being crucified at the thought of the sacrifice of life which this attack will make," Pickett quotes Longstreet as saying (p.98). "I have instructed Alexander to watch the effect of our fire upon the enemy, and when it begins to tell he must take the responsibility and give you the orders, for I can't." He goes on to describe Longstreet's silence and anguish. "he bowed his head upon his breast. I shall neer forget the look in his face nor the clasp of his hand when I said: ---'Then, General, I shall lead my Division on.'" (p.99) With the loss of his division, Pickett's own optimism about the battle has been defeated. "Well, it is all over now. The battle is lost, and many of us are prisoners, many are dead, many wounded, bleeding and dying. Your Soldier [which is what Pickett called himself to his betrothed] lives and mourns and but for you ... he would rather, a million times rather, be back there with his dead, to sleep for all time in an unknown grave." (p.100) "This is too gloomy and too poor a letter for so beautiful a sweetheart," he wrote a few days later, "but it seems sacrilegious, almost, to say I love you, with the heartss that are stilled to love on the field of battle." (103). These examples are not exhaustive, of course, but they give a hint at what this volume contains: love, affection and kindness, more than politics or ideology. Pickett sometimes quotes his black servant (mostly calls him his "boy" and once "my n__er") in vernacular, which are at once fascinating and hard to read. If it were a work of fiction, the slave could almost serve as a comic relief, obstinate and opinionated, but now is the person who has known Pickett for his entire life, it seems, and when Pickett's paternal home is burned down by Northern soldiers, even explains to him the value of Home. Which illustrates exactly the dangers of viewing the black slave population as monolithic in their desires to flee the South for freedom. (Simplistically put, of course. This review is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of race relations in the Old South.)The book doesn't immediately start with the letters, but with an introduction by the then widowed La Salle Corbell Pickett, who decided to have the letters published some fifty years after the War. It is a precious introduction, with affection and humor, which contains the portrayal of visit by Abraham Lincoln, shortly after the war (p.15-16): "'The President!' I gasped. The stranger shook his head and said: 'No ma'am; no ma'am; just Abraham Lincoln; George's old friend.'" And after Lincoln holds La Salle's baby ("... an expression of rapt, almost divine, tenderness and love lighted up the sad face.") and hands her back, he tells the baby, who has just given him "a dewy infantile kiss," to "Tell your father, the rascal, that I forgive him for the sake of that kiss and those bright eyes." All in all, it offers much humanity in the often abstraced study of history, and warms the heart to read. Even if Pickett fought on the wrong side of history.
I know it's a kids book, and it's far from perfect. But it's still great fun to read and every time I watch and read the Harry Potter series, I am more impressed with the world that was created, especially on the personal scale. Except that I don't care much for Quidditch, which defies much logic, to be frank. The idea of a keeper in other sports is that he is different to field players: in (field) hockey he can use his feet; in soccer he can use his hands. Why the need for a keeper in quidditch? The differentiation between beaters and chasers is also beyond me. Are beaters allowed to score, or are they simply there to slug the bludgers? And in this book Harry's deductions and suspicions are a lot more sensible than in the movie, which is my biggest gripe with the adaptation.
I like this episode in the Harry Potter adventure series, I honestly do. The students and story lines are growing up, it seems; but it maintains its humor throughout. Yet, in a sense it is the least favorite of the series so far, because the pattern emerges that follows from the format: throughout the year there's a mysterious culprit on the loose, an evil henchman of Voldemort who, it turns out, is not the person we're being led on to believe is the one during the majority of the book. Coneniently, at the end of the year this is all resolved and the kids can go home for the summer vacation. I have found that I love the world building---the variety and originality of the creatures, the seemingly endless realm of magical possibilities, and most impressively how Rowling has made interesting the absolutely mundane of everyday activities. Sometimes I wish for there to be no adventure in Potter's life, and maybe for there to be more History of Hogwarts, or a more detailed description of Muggle Studies. After all, even if the has lived among lowly non-magic people her entire childhood, Hermione finds it interesting to look at Muggle life through the lens of wizards. Then again, if Rowling took a page of George R. R. Martin's book, she probably wouldn't have finished her 20-tome series on Harry Potter's academic career.My main issue with this book, aside from the neat end-of-year resolution, is the fact that in this world building, Rowling felt the need to re-introduce each concept and every character. This becomes apparent on page one, but it prevalent through at least the first half of the book: "Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of the year ... and he also happened to be a wizard." You don't say? I've been reading 650+ pages of a book series called Harry Potter, and the author deems it necessary to introduce the main character?To be sure, it's not the best example, but it is the first of many, on the first of many pages. Crabbe and Goyle are re-introduced to us in detailed description; Quidditch, for heaven's sake, is elaborately re-introduced with explanations of different kinds of players and balls. I had rather this would have been suggested away by an editor, and re-filled with new world building.P.S. I've heard this explained away by this being a children's book, and the fact that the books were published a year or more apart. I'd suggest re-reading the first books, rather than stuffing the new book with repetitious filler.
Steve Berry addresses is this book an interestic topic: that of secession. Too bad it looks like the only thing he read on Lincoln was a Thomas DiLorenzo book, selective citing out of context, criticizing a strawman Lincoln Myth that no one adheres to. The explanatory postscriptum merely adds insult to injury.
Dave Gorman has taken on another project, as he is wont to do: this time it isn't finding other people named Dave Gorman, or finding people who own a website that has a Googlewhack on them, or even driving across the United States visiting only non-chain restaurants, hotels, and gas stations. No, this time instead of taking one big vacation, he takes numerous small ones, spending a few days in different locations across the UK, to play games with people. As someone who is diving into the board game hobby myself, I was looking forward to someone else's writing about the hobby, especially someone who I know to be so funny. Gorman throughout the book doesn't disappoint. He's funny, he meets nice people, and his ability to find the adventure in wacky non-topics is admirable. Sadly, Gorman's project also feels rather undefined. Reaching the opposite coast of the US or finding a chain of 10 Googlewhackers are clear-cut goals, whereas this book at times felt rather uninspired. Gorman simply takes people up on an invitation to come play a game -- no matter what kind of game. Many of the games are fun to read about, and most of them I don't know and will never play. But the lackluster commitment is most obvious in the area of gaming I like best: the deep, crunchy board game. Every time Gorman cannot grasp the game in one session, he feels less of a real participant and more of a pawn who's being told what to do. So many of the games he enjoys are dexterity games, or old games that young Dave used to play. Every time, say, Carcassone or Tuscany or Settlers of Catan are mentioned, Gorman doesn't practice in order to get to know the board games better in order to be able to compete next time; no, he simply concludes those games are not for him. Of course, it's his book, they are his rules, and he doesn't HAVE to like the games (I know I don't, as they're competitive), but this limits the scope of the book and makes the project feel lacluster. Instead, Gorman opted to write about local histories, or sceneries, longer that I cared for at times. Go play a game, tell me about the game and why it is so interesting or funny or why people are so enamored with it! I liked the book, laughed out loud many times; but I also felt it was in many ways a missed opportunity.
"Three months in the Southern States," by British Colonel Fremantle, was written in 1863 and based on the diary he kept during his sojourns in the same year. Fremantle travels through nearly all the States of the Confederacy and on his way meets general, soldiers and civilians alike. His descriptions of the places he sees are brief but ever fascinating, with highlights such as Mobile, AL, and Charleston, SC, eventually culminating at the battle of Gettysburg and his presence in New York during the draft riots of mid-july. He remained optimistic as to the chances of Southern victory, because the Confederate army did not seem dispirited at all, and he concluded: "I never can believe that in the nineteenth century the civilised world will be condemned to witness the destruction of such a gallant race."As an aside, which I cannot dig into too deeply here: his observations on the benevolence of slavery, and it being transplanted Yankees who are the ones who mistreat slaves (cf pages 79, 84, 88), while simultaneously witnessing a couple of Southerners beating up a slave (p.92), is fascinating and bordering on (if not outright) Propaganda.
This book examines Lee's reputation as a military genius, and finds it lacking. Lee's brilliance lay on the defensive, but he too often chose the offensive that cost him men, battles, and eventually the war. Lee was weak strategically, inventively, and logistically, in a War that demanded new insights because of the changed character of weapons and technology. Northern Generals like Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan serve as examples of how to conduct this new-style warfare. McKenzie does a great job of explaining all this, using many major battles as examples. An absolute must-read for Civil War buffs.
This is a nice book that will get you through a hot summer's day or a cold winter evening. It moves like a brook, much more than a river, even when suspense seems the mood the author want to invoke. The story is basically about Rosemary, emigré in the USA and starting her life anew. Soon she finds a job in an antiquarian bookstore with the odd odd characters: there's the obese, nude-photography loving homosexual, the study-obsessed asexual, the straightforward heterosexuals and the comforting transsexual. Not to mention the ambiguity of those who basically run the shop: sometimes brilliant, oftentimes questionable. All these employees make for an interesting about the used book business. Interspersed is a story about a lost manuscript of Hermann Melville, the search by different people for the book, and how Rosemary gets trapped in between her loyalties for those people. The quest and accompanying psychological hardships never quite convince, however, so one is left mostly with the atmosphere of the bookstore and Melville's passionate friendship with Hawthorne (whom he met, coincidentally, on my birthday, 130 years before).All in all, I give it three stars, because I had no trouble finishing the book and remain well entertained. Perhaps, if it had been a non-fiction history, it had entertained me even more. After all, "truth is stranger than fiction."
As a combination of my two favorite genres, non-fiction Civil War and travel memoirs, this book is somewhere among my top rankings. Horwitz is at times informative, entertaining, serious and funny. He travels through the South of the mid-nineties, meanwhile talking to interesting people of every kind: from re-enactors to history teachers to the oldest living widow of a Confederate soldier. He is always respectful (if he seems to call people nutty, it's always in the context of himself joining in and being a Civil Bore himself), but never shy of critical reflection on what he encounters.It is a laid-back way of getting to know something about the Civil War and ways in which it still pervades some elements in the contemporary American culture.
This book, for all its supposed adventures, is actually quite boring. The protagonist turns green and walks the streets at night. That's it. Far from outstanding, it was rather disappointing.
This is not really a book about "strange battles of the Civil War" and as such is a misnomer. It's a nice book that discusses all sorts of battles, from the attack of the Hunley in Charleston, to John Bell Hood's devastating attack at Franklin, TN. The chapters are short, with an average of a little over fifteen pages each, which is the kind of length that gives enough information as to be entertaining and never get bogged down in too much detail. It's a good book to get introduced to the topic. The author does seem to be smitten with Robert E. Lee, though, to the extent that he has an excuse for everything that went wrong under Lee's supervision --- it's usually some general who foolishly misinterpreted an order or the situation at hand. The 7 days' campaign, which cost Lee a large percentage of his troops, he Garrison deems brilliant. It was very effective in chasing George McClellan away from the vicinity of Richmond, to be sure, but it was also very costly --- a cost that the South could scarcely bear indefinitely. That's my largest gripe, however. It's a solid enough book.
This book is thoroughly entertaining and educating as well. Ferguson approaches Lincoln from different angles (travel, historiography, current affairs), and is humorous or serious when the situation demands it. Both critical and an avid fan of Lincoln, Ferguson seems to have tried to find the best of both worlds and put it into this book. It has made me reconsider the way I think of Lincoln. No longer is he a mere icon, an abstraction that springs from theory, but he is Man as well as Icon: someone who, because he was a human being, can serve as an example of which feats people can achieve; meanwhile, he is an icon because what he did was so special.
John Greens “The fault in our stars” is an at times breathtaking, continuously surprizing and intermittently tragic, funny and touching, beautiful book, which in an unfaltering pace tells about the love, wishes, struggles and disillusions in the lives of cancer-ridden youths. It is filled with quotable passages that, once cited, are followed by even more quotable passages, which leave you with a lump in your throat. (People more sensitive than I will shed many a tear; less sensitive people will be touched by Green's descriptions.)Find a comfortable spot, surrounded by pillows, an emergency stock of drinks to keep hydrated and shut out the world, because you will want to keep reading and finish this book in one take. An added bonus is that the book is currently being made into a movie (planned in 2014). Knowing the process of filming is frequently moving the author to tears, makes that I can hardly wait for it to come out. Till such time, I make do with the book and will probably re-read it more than once.
As a rule of thumb, books are better than the movie or series adaptations of those books. Books can give you more of an inner world, a perspective on thoughts and memories, that is much more clunky to achieve on the screen. No so for the Witcher. To be sure, this is volume 0.5 of the book series, so things may improve from here on out, but the book is simply a narration of some adventures or encounters the Witcher has, without exploring into detail who this Witcher is or who Witchers in general are. He slays monsters in a stoic fashion. The series probably mixed elements of later books to make up for the monotony, following the development of Yennefer, for instance. And I feel it shouldn't take more than one book of a series to be entertained. Of course, the fact that I have already watched the tv show and therefore knew exactly what would happen may have spoiled the book instead of keeping me on the edge of my seat. But there was a definte want of depth and development within this volume. I did love the casual references to familiar fairy tale stories (Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, Cinderella) as actual events within the world of the Witcher, but would have liked them to be better developed. I did not love the fact that the translator opted to drop the name of Jaskier (a Polish name, which translates to Buttercup) for a different flower: Dandilion (sic). The tv show did well not to translate the name and just go with Jaskier.
Hallowed Ground is one of my all-time favorite books. It combines two genres I love most, travelogue and history, into a volume of perfect proportions (which can serve as a companion when one chooses to take the walk around Gettysburg). Its clear and elegant prose is delightful, and McPherson as a guide is serious enough to convey the larger outlines of the battle, and so knowledgeable as to sprinkle his tour with anecdotes, meanwhile dispensing with myths. Absolutely recommend this, if you want a pleasant introduction into the battle of Gettysburg.
This book should have been named "Statues in the shadow of race in New Orleans." Whereas I was expecting a personal and political contemplation on the removal of the Confederate Statues in New Orleans (and beyond), I was treated with Landrieu's contemplation of how race played a role in much of his life and the politics around him. He says he's not running for president in 2020, but this sure seems like a pamphlet to convince (African-)Americans that he is, basically, a swell guy who can do little wrong. The disappointment is even stronger, for when Landrieu actually does write about his discovery of the Lost Cause and the politics behind the statues, it becomes interesting for people like me who, based on the title, want to know more about the behind the scenes on the removal of Lee, Beauregard, and Davis (still, oddly enough, no mention of Drieux, another Confederate statue, across the street from Davis). I'm curious to see what happens if Landrieu joins the fray of Presidential elections, but that wasn't why I picked up this book.
This book had been lurking at me from some faraway corner in my book cases for a few years, but having finally picked it up, I could hardly put it down. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, especially the playful use of literary references in people's dating rituals: exchanges about restaurants based on novels (92), or comparing someone to a book: "I've seen you on the shelf for years. I've read the synopsis and the quotes on the back. Sketchy, but it's enough to make me want to read on" (196-197). Eventually, it reminded me of Hay's novel "The secret of lost things," in that it involves a bookstore and a mystery, but whereas I love Secret for how it delves into Melville and Hawthorne, this one captivated me for the sheer humor and heart. "We're not quite novels," the protagonist muses (235), "... We're not quite short stories ... In the end, we are collected works. He has read enough to know there are no collections where each story is perfect. Some hits. Some misses. If you're lucky, a stand-out. And in the end, people only really remember the stand-outs anyway, and they don't remember those for very long."
The View from Flyover Country is not the kind of book that I was expecting, which is probably because I read some recommendation in a book that I loved and did not look for more information before I acquired the book. I expected a travel memoir, from someone who traveled around the Midwest and researched the people who lived there. Instead, it is a collection of articles Kendzior wrote between 2012 and 2015, mainly about contemporary economic struggles and how they remain invisible to those who do make it---mainly, those with the means to afford increasing college costs. Moreover, whereas getting a University degree used to equal the opportunity of moving up the rungs of society's ladder, nowadays it is indicative of being able to afford paying $50.000 for college and subsequent unpaid internships. Indeed, she argues, that “... while barriers based on race and gender have eased---to a degree, with still a long way to go---economic strictures have tightened, denying the dreams of a new generation.” (p72) and in another essay: “Money, not gender, is the biggest barrier to a career in international relations, or any prestige industry. It eliminates the bulk of the talent pool from the start. Building a career in policy often means not only living o little income, but paying for your way around the world.” (p188) An example which Kendzior returns to more than once: “Interning at the United Nations means relocating temporarily, unpaid, to expensive cities.” (ibid)Ironically, race and gender seem more in the limelight, whereas class has moved to the periphery of today's social awareness. Talk of privilege has moved to areas of whiteness and being male, perhaps because those who can afford to have such discussions are in the position not to recognize their class privilege. It made me appreciate this collection of articles all the more. That being said, the fact that they are a collection of previously written essays, does lead to repetition of arguments and examples; and I think I would have better appreciated a more consistent and indepth analysis of the poverty issue by the same author. It would have made for a thinner book, but a stronger argument, I think. Another, slight criticism, is the fact that much of the book doesn't actually touch on the “flyover country” aspect. It starts off in that direction, and the epilogue attempts to glue the whole together by returning to it, but the fact that the increase of poverty encompasses much of the population seems to cancel out the title a little. But these are minor issues, for the essays are interesting and I do recommend reading the book, to understand American society and issues better.
This book is beautifully descriptive and, although it is at times rather dark, it makes for a great read.
Butler's KINDRED could serve as a reading companion to Colson Whitehead's UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. Both capture the suffocation of slave society, as well as the fear of being captured, whipped, or sold down South. Both do so by using a surreal element (time travel and an actual underground railroad) as plot device to tell a compelling story. Both are very successful. Butler's protagonist, a 1976 African-American woman by the name of Dana, travels back in time, to the early 1800s, where her ancestor, a white kid and later adult from Maryland, calls to her whenever he's in dire need of being saved. Each time she helps him out, she stays at the plantation as if she were a slave. The only way for her to return to her own era, is for her to be in actual danger. The time and area provide ample opportunity for that. The book focuses on Dana's thoughts and experiences, mainly, and other characters may feel less fleshed out, but I think it's one of the strong points of the book, as it doesn't digress into elaborating on different motivations, but maintains focus and personal ignorance about the motivations of other people around her. This way, when other slaves betray her or gossip about her, the reader learns it at the same time an unsuspecting Dana learns about it. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I definitely recommend it to people who enjoyed Whitehead's novel.
This book is a classic that most people should read, if only to understand what everyone is talking about. The first time I read 1984 I was thoroughly impressed by this ominous view of a future dictatorship; when I read Anthem, Ayn Rand's 1938 dystopia novella, and the philosophy behind that story, I felt that 1984 fell short philosophically. After all, the Orwellian premise that creativity (and, ultimately, technology) will not falter in the face of utter mind control, may prove faulty indeed. Politically and psychologically, the book still stands firm. Not only a critique on communism, as is widely acknowledged, it is also a warning of the expanding control of so-called democratic (or market-economic) states that is applicable in todays terror-ridden world. Most impressive I found the burst of the bubble of security (and anonimity), and the elaboration on personal fear, which will make us choose, eventually, for ourselves over the other.
Wonderful book. There is a sense of compassion and disgust towards the main character. Very interesting to read what life was like in the circumstances the character is in. If you like literature is I definitely recommend it!
Amazing book that puts humanity in perspective. This book provides people with a whole new look on history and humankind in general.
This is without a doubt the most urgent book I've read in 2019 so far and I can recommend this book to literally everyone: from students to adults, from new parents to CEOs of companies. Once you read about the great benefits of sleep and the harm of sleep deprivation, you don't want to sleep less than 8 hours ever again. It is not a book that helps reader to have healthy sleeping habits, but the information will make you do the changes by yourself.
I normally don't give 5 stars a lot, but this book is just genius. The way the Russian Revolution and communism is explained is just amazing. The characters are vivid, the metaphors are perfect and all by all it's just a fun book. The best thing might be that even children could understand this. This I a way to explain corruption, history and politics to the people that don't even like it!
** spoiler alert ** This book is clearly targeted to women - which isn't a bad thing persé - and I only picked it up because I ran out of books during my travel. And I don't regret this choice!The beginning of the book started fine and I really enjoyed the image that was drawn of the high-end shop with a few regular visitors that all have their own personality but have a few things in common: their love for luxury and for plastic surgery. However, when the crimes took place, there was a huge sequence of "coincidences" that put me off as a reader quite a bit. Due to this I didn't "buy" everything that was happening anymore and I found the book to become unrealistic. In addition, I believe that some aspects of the end are a bit forced, like the relationship story and there was a lack of character development.So a by all, I enjoyed the book, even though it was strained. It's an easy read if you just want to read something without overthinking too much, as it's pretty straightforward.
To start with, this book does not contain a lot of new thoughts, but it isn't packed with useful information, thought evoking theories and fun facts. It starts of as a regular history book, describing how the world came to be, what changed, and how we got where we are now. In order to do this, Bergman quotes many historians an philosophers, which gives the reader a vivid image. Additionally, the fun anecdotes are perfect for the next party. Right afterwards there is a part which states that our time is way better than the past and why not everything was better "back in the good ol' days". This is the thing that got me hooked, because I really despise it when I hear older people saying things like this. Heck, even though I'm quite young I hear people of my age talking nostalgically about times when they weren't even born! However, there is one part lacking here, and that's the part about happiness. Isn't it all about happiness in the end? Yes, he does mention it, but I'd like to know the thoughts of more philosophers on what happiness is and how to become happy. Did this change over time? It ends with a thought-provoking argument about utopias that really made me think. Is it possible to make progress? Does the utopia exist? How do I want the future to be? This is why I'd like to quote the last few sentences of the book:"But this does not mean that we cannot think, hope or dream about the future. Looking forward to another life and another society is an essential part of doing things and letting them happen. An utopia without a blueprint doesn't let us get away from reality, but invites me to enter it. Connecting an utopical passion with the reality of our time is challenge of this time. Because a generation that does not want to dream, loses its rights for a better world"
Yet another urgent book read this year! I have always been interested in statistics and during every geography class I ended up simply staring in the atlas looking for facts about wellbeing, economy, safety, health etcetera of countries around he world. Unfortunately, these maps only show the current situation and not the development over the past. I have always been proud that the Netherlands was among the best countries in nearly every way. However, these statistics give a very skewed view of the world and it isn't really how it it. The word is developing quickly, but sometimes it seems like we're blind to change. This book is exactly what you need to see that change is present in every country and that the world as a whole is getting better. Sure, the world can be bad, but that doesn't mean it is not getting better.
It's hard rating this book for some reason. I really loved the aphorisms and thought provoking quotes in this book. Sometimes I even reread a sentence several times so I could really understand it and I could even remember it. There are several lessons you can get out of this book: Live your own legend, sometimes you don't have to look far to find your personal treasure and always listen to your heart. I loved the way Coelho translated these lessons in to words, notwithstanding I may not agree with all of them. Additionally, I didn't really like the fact that the 'boy' is the only one that underwent character development and that I couldn't even identify that well with him. The other characters were vivid and interesting, but they didn't feel like real people.
Not long ago, I read this quote stating that the Holocaust didn't kill 6 million persons, but killed one person 6 million times. The enormous quantity of people killed during this heinous events is just impossible to imagine. However, The Tattooist of Auschwitz by Heather Morris is a book of two persons who don't make up the 'statistic' of 6 million people. The book is about two persons fortunate enough to survive. The Tattooist of Auschwitz offers a clear image of life in world's most notorious concentration camp, while contradictorily describing a love story in the worst of times.Even though the theme of the book is quite fierce, the book is easy to get through nonetheless. The relatively short sentences give the book a nice flow and it is all written down in an understandable manner.
I've never had goosebumps when reading the end of a book, but this book gave me goosebumps all over my body. The ending is like a jigsaw falling into place, it's like ending a vicious circle, it's like reaching the last station of a train that never stops and how someone else explained it here: it's like waking up from a dream. Admittedly, I did have a hard time to get into this book. Some generations of Arelianos/Joses appealed to me more than the others, but Marquez's vivid writing style, mesmerising phrases and thought provoking stories kept me hooked nonetheless.
This is a must-read for everyone planning to visit Peru and especially Cusco. I have lived in the old Capital of the Inca's for nearly half a year and the city really came to life when I read the Last Days of the Incas.Even though the book is clearly non-fiction with many chronicles written by the Spanish, some parts really read away like a regular story. Lastly, this book covers an interesting part of world history that we do not learn at Western schools.
Space has always interested me and this book has been a must-read for me ever since I heard of its existence. ''An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth'' definetly did not let me down! Even though this is not a self-help book (which is a genre I am not really into), this book has taught and motivated me more than the self-help books that I did read. The positive mindset of Hadfield is simply inspiring and motivating and it is clear that being in space gave him a different view on earth - both literally and figuratively. He teaches you to work hard, to not always aim to be the best, to know where you are and what your possition is and most importantly: to stay humble. However, at times, the book seemed a bit repetitive. While writing this I feel a bit ashamed, because Chris really had to sit through all the sims himself while I got 'bored' a little bit by simply reading about them already. But that was my experience with the book.Lastly, it was fun to read the differences between how NASA works in this book and how SpaceX works in the biography of Elon Musk. They are both space agencies, but they see things totally different. Aight, more roads lead to Rome
I can see why this book appeals to many people, but to me it was a bit lackluster. There wasn't really any character development, the plot took a bit to long to become interesting and the book was pretty short.
''Freedom is the freedom to say that two and two make four. If that is granted, everything else follows.''Interesting book (or even an essay) by George Orwell about a dystopia on planet earth and what will happen whem everything you know, all things you learnt in the past can be altered by the government at any time. What happens when humans are controlled incessantly by the authorities, when even your thoughts and opinions are a crime? What happens when the government decides what the truth is, even though it is not. What happens, when you don't have the freedom to think that two and two make four?''I'll stay home forever where two and two always makes a five''
This is one of the books I expected a bit more of. I hoped it would cover more on Buddhist practices and there would be more parts where it is really the Dalai Lama speaking and explaining things from his perspective. Instead, at times, it turned a bit more into a self-help book, which is not really my genre. However, I have to give credit to the way that the author explains things on an easy and understandable way and contrary, I also liked that he said things about science. Additionally, I enjoyed the last part of the book a lot, as it really included some thought provoking material.
Yes, it took me forever to finish this book, but for all the good reasons! It is really necessary to think and process the information that can be found in this book. You simply don't get the most out of it if you're just binge-reading it. This is also the reason why I will put this book on the toilet, so I can skim some chapters through to get reminded of some of the principles.Even though this book has a pretty manipulative title, it is not! It actually makes people more charismatic and teaches some tricks to get things done, without blackmailing, getting angry or being a total d*ckhead. The anecdotes used to illustrate this are good and vivid and are worth remembering. The only con is that the stories are quite a bit outdated, but that doesn't take a way a lot from the experience.Overall, How to Win Friends and Influence People is a goodread
Getting There by G.Z.Segal had some very inspiring stories. They teach that starting up a business is hard and takes a lot of effort. It also motivates people to never give up.However, the book got a bit repetitive at the end
Let me preface this by saying I had very high hopes for this book prior to starting it and that my opinions of books mostly center around the question: did this book make me feel things? The story is amazing and astonishing, and awful and painful; the book as a whole made me feel frustrated and hopeless and melancholic and reflective. It is most definitely a masterpiece and I would recommend it to book lovers. The only, very dull, downsides, for me, were the perspective changes and keeping up with characters. It took me about 200 pages to understand which character was which and I still forgot sometimes throughout the book, and when the perspective switched between chapters I often got very confused and had to consciously memorise details to figure it out. Also, it is very long. 720 pages is no small feat and I definitely took much longer than I usually do to read this amount of pages. Overall, loved the story and its wise but frustrating perspective. A recommendation, definitely, to be read when in the right mindset for a mind-boggling description of ‘a little life’.
Loved this, could not stop reading. Incredible slow burn, interesting characters, and suspense that killed me. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a romantic (and funny) page-turner! 💕
⭐️⭐️✨ / 2.5 starsThis book was an easy read, and I thoroughly enjoyed some parts of it. For instance, the parts about loss and having a sick parent really resonated with me. Also the complicated mother/daughter relationship was interesting but could’ve used more exploration. Unfortunately though, I found the general dating story to be frustrating and bleak (in the non-philosophical way). I craved a more critical view of relationships and more introspection, but it felt flat at times. I don’t think I would recommend this book to a friend as I don’t agree with a lot of the ideas in it, unfortunately. Nonetheless, an entertaining book to read on your commute.
4,5 / ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨Beautiful, heartbreaking, disconcerting, and heartwarming all at once.
⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ - 3.5/5This was a fun and easy read that did actually draw me back in after every chapter. The conflict resolution was nice and wholesome but the timeline felt unrealistic (it’s just a story I know), and I would have liked to relate to it a bit more by letting more time pass and including more reflective thoughts. Overall, we love a bitta gay and it was interesting to learn more about Armenian culture and language.
Like for the last 3 books I read, my review will come in a little while!
In my review of An Ember in the Ashes I said: 'I think the best way I can describe this book is intense'. This definitely also goes for this book. I feel like so much happened and there were some plot twists I still can't wrap my mind around. Regarding the biggest one, I was suspecting something, but the actual thing was so much more intricate and just aaaaaaah, I cannot even properly explain the way I feel about this book and about everything that happened.I don't really know what I was expecting when going into this book, but I think somewhere in the back of my brain I was just expecting everything to just going to go smoothly, so I kept kind of being surprised everytime something went wrong. But of course that is not something that happens in books, it would probably make it quite boring, so I really don't know where it went wrong in my brains. The rest of this 'review' is going to be me talking about the characters, which is probably not very interesting if you haven't read An Ember in the Ashes, sorry. My advice to you is, read this series, you will definitely be better off. I liked that Helene got her own chapters in the book. I was probably not as interested in her story as I was in Elias and Laia's journey, but she was not what I expected. She is so much stronger and badass than I thought. And Marcus, well he and the Commandant remained giant pains in my behind. I feel quite sorry for Helene who has to put up with them.Oh, and Helene and Harper? Hell yes.I don't know what it was about Afya (let's be honest, she was kind of a bitch at first), but I liked her too. She was funny and probably the biggest Elias and Laia shipper, which is a really important thing to me.Laia, I feel like, has grown even more since the ending of An Ember in the Ashes. She is really growing into the person she is supposed to be and that person is really wonderful. Oh, and that 'thing' is pretty cool.Keenan. I'm just going to say one word: no.Okay, maybe a little bit more clarification. Some of the things he said I liked, because they were deep and insightful and I kind of want someone to say things like that to me, but those were the only things I liked coming out of his mouth. I think this makes it clear I am not aboard the Laia and Keenan ship, never was actually.So, now let's finally talk a little bit about Elias, I promise I will keep it short. My question for him is: Why aren't you real? If he were, I would 100% marry him. I just love Elias. Although my heart does hurt a little bit for him.Oh, how I love this series. It is just great.I'll leave some beautiful quotes here at the end, because An Ember in the Ashes and this one are filled with them:“So long as you fight the darkness, you stand in the light.”“Failure doesn't define you. It's what you do after you fail that determines whether you are a leader or a waste of perfectly good air.” “Don't lock yourself away from those who care about you because you think you'll hurt them or they'll hurt you. What point is there in being human if you don't let yourself feel anything?”
Not really my kind of book. Took me a really long time to get through.
No, no, you can't end a book like that. What the heck, I don't know if I can handle this. I'll be going now, I need to read Blood Promise. Oh, and Adrian. Yes, I still like you very much. I don't know why no one is talking about you.
My review will be coming very soon! And this time I promise I wil actually stick to that...
I considered stopping reading this book quite a few times. I didn't though, and I can't say I'm glad I stuck to it.I was just hoping that at some point things would start kicking off and I'd be more interested in the story, but unfortunately that didn't happen.None of the characters really impressed me or were very memorable.The plot didn't do much for me and I felt like everything that happened in the book was rushed.Things started to get a little better when the revolution began, and the book was okay after that, but it still didn't do much for me.Something that also annoyed me a lot were the random French words thrown into the sentences. I understand that the book is set in France and you use French words like Monsieur or Mademoiselle, but I felt like Kathleen Benner Duble used it for too many other words, causing the French to become a bit overused. I did feel that towards the end it was used less often, or maybe it just started to grow on me by then.Lastly, I just want to talk about the fact that the main character is called Célie Rousseau. Kathleen Benner Duble could've called Célie anything, but she chose to name her after a French philosopher. I think that is a bit trite.
I fricking love this book. It just made me so happy. I've been wanting to read this book since it came out, but I've finally gotten my hands on it. I'll leave the story about that at the end, because it's probably not very interesting... *The characters were great. I absolutely love Magnus, Sam, Hearth, Blitz, T.J., Halfborn, X, Mallory and Jack. And alright, okay, I even like Gunilla. (I really hope I haven't forgotten someone)I thought I'd just sum up some things about this book that made me really happy:1. The dedication: 'To Cassandra ClareThanks for letting me share the excellent name Magnus'Because I fully agree with it.2. Magnus Chase3. An appearance of someone... You can guess this even if you haven't read the book, but think very hard (Wow, very vague, I know).4. The title of chapter 485. And all the other titles of the chapters6. Odin, and that plottwist7. Loki, I don't know what it is, I guess I kind of like the bad guys, since I also like Set from 'The Kane Chronicles'.8. And basically every other fricking thing in this amazing bookDear mr. Rick Riordan, I want to thank you, you have once again done an amazing job.* I really want to own the American version of this book, because in my opinion it is way prettier than the British version. The only problem is that I live in the Netherlands and here usually the American versions aren't released until a year after the original release date, so I was just planning to wait that long (I know, I'm crazy). But last week when I was roaming around the site of my library I stumbled upon the English version of this book, which I should mention is some kind of miracle considering there are about ten English book in my library. I basically raced to the library and now I read it half a year later then I would have liked, but at least I didn't have to wait a year.Wow, congratulations if you're still reading this, because that was one boring story. Ten points to you if you have made it this far into this review that consists of only half a part review and the other half the boring story above...
I watched the film back when it came out in 2014 and I wasn't the biggest fan of it. I had kind of forgotten about Vampire Academy, but came across it again a few weeks ago. I decided to buy the books, because the books must be good if they decided to make a film of it. And let's be honest, a lot of book to film adaptations are bad. So I decided to give it a shot.I made a very good desicion, because I loved this book. I've been sucked (sorry, that was the worst pun ever) into the world of Moroi, Dhampirs and Strigoi.I love how funny it is, the plot is good and I like most of the characters.The high school drama was great. It's just like the idea people have who are not from the US of how American high schools are (although it's probably nothing like that).The mean girls, hot obnoxious boys and just a lot of high school drama. Oh, and let's not forget they're all vampires.I really like Rose, she is definitely my favourite character so far. I love how sarcastic, sassy and snarky (wow, look at that alliteration) her comebacks are. She's also really badass.I'm not too sure about Lissa yet, I didn't hate her, but also didn't love her. But after reading the book, I do understand why she behaved like she sometimes did.But the friendship they have is great.Overall I think this is fun and easy (although the end was quite intense) read.The only shame is that now every time I read about Dimitri I see the guy they casted in the film.I'm sorry Danila Kozlovsky, but Dimitri was described as 'super hot' and only 24 in Vampire Academy, and I don't think they chose the right guy to play Dimitri in the film.When you google Danila Kozlovsky, he doesn't look too bad, but I just didn't think he looked really hot in the film, I'm sorry.
No, this was not a book for me. I did not enjoy it.I went into this book knowing practically nothing about it, since the blurb doesn't give anything away (look at the book description here on Goodreads, it's the same as the blurb). I read some reviews and they said that it is better going into the book knowing nothing about it.If you were to ask me to give you a summary of the book without giving spoilers, I couldn't do it. I'm not even sure if I could tell you anything useful about the plot at all if I could give spoilers.The book was divided into four parts. The first two parts bored me to death. Nothing happened and the only thing I grasped from it was how messed up the Sinclair family is. The first part was an introduction which was only a few pages, but the second part took up most of the book, and it was so boring, absolutely nothing happened. It also left me with a lot of questions as Cadence had an accident and doesn't remember the events around her accident.When part three came around, I finally started to get a little bit more interested in the book, because Cadence began remembering stuff again. My questions finally started getting answers.Then part four rolled around, and I was honestly surprised. I did not expect the plot to take a turn like it did and I felt really sorry for Cadence and even for her family. Her life is really messed up.
Oh my god, I don't even know where to start. This book is absolutely amazing. I need the next book NOW. I'll admit I didn't really like the first like 100 pages (probably less though), because of one person, whom I will not name, because I'm not sure if it's a spoiler or not...After that there are 500 pages that are just so great. I laughed, cried and was at the edge of my seat constantly. And there were so many incredible plottwists. I'm quite sad I don't get to read this book for the first time again.
Wow, this book. I'm not going to lie, it took some time for me to get into this book. You are just thrust into the world and you need to get used to the lingo at first, because there is a lot of it. But after that, oh man was it great. So let me list all of the things that make this novel so amazing: The world Pierce Brown has created is so intricate and well thought out, it's amazing. The plot is full of jaw dropping twists and turns you do not see coming, but all of it ties together and it is just so well thought out, I don't understand how someone all came up with that (I certainly lack that kind of creativity). I liked the characters. Darrow is just a no shit kind of guy, who also has a darker side, which I liked. The characters aren't flat, there is so much more to them. Although, there are a lot of other characters, so it can be a little bit hard to keep track of everyone. The writing is beautiful. I have found Pierce Brown makes many tiny references to things. Most probably go over my head, but when I get one, I'm quite proud of myself. I think rereading the book will be a great experience too, because then I'll be able to see all the hints that were dropped prior to a twist or turn, which I didn't see reading the book for the first time. I don't think Pierce Brown's writing style is very easy, so if you are just starting out with reading English books, you might want to wait a little bit longer before picking this book up, so you can enjoy it in all of its glory. The references to Greek and Roman mythology are pretty cool too, but that might just be because I really like mythology. I've seen this book compared to The Hunger Games plenty of times, so I'll share my opinion on the matter too. It's a great tag line to get people to read the book. To some extent this book is similar to The Hunger Games, but I think it's not fair to Red Rising to be compared to The Hunger Games, because Red Rising is just so much more. Don't get me wrong, I loved The Hunger Games, but Red Rising just takes that extra step. It is just that bit more intricate and complex in everything. I feel like I can't adequately explain it, but this is going to have to do, because I don't how to say it differently. Oh, and this book doesn't just consist of fighting scenes, there is also quite some political intrigue and mind games, which is a nice switch. Also, am I the only one who kept thinking about 1984 whilst reading this book and saw some similarities?You know, now I get why so many people love these books.
Why can't I give six stars? I liked this book even better than Cinder and Scarlet, which I both gave five stars, but how could I know this one would be even better?I loved reading the story from so many perspectives, I always like reading how the different characters think about situations.That ending, that one thing that happened in the last few pages made me really happy. If you read the book you'll know what I'm talking about.And Thorne, yes I'm still not over how amazing he is.
I don’t know what to say about this. I loved this trilogy, definitely one of my new favourites!The writing, the worldbuilding, the intricate story, the characters and well, basically everything. Laini Taylor is amazing. Read this series, please, you will not regret it.
Okay, so this is probably more like 3.5 stars, but I’ll be generous and round it up. I liked this book, but the biggest problem for me was the pacing. The ending was so rushed, I wish Margaret Rogerson had taken it a bit slower. The pacing at the beginning was just right. But then, the middle part was just too slow without enough happening, especially comparing it to the end. I still have some question that weren’t answered. The romance was a bit quick, but I was actually fine with it. The writing is absolutely beautiful. Also, I really liked Rook. I’m interested to see what Margaret Rogerson will write next.
I love Sarah J. Maas. I mean after I started reading Throne of Glass until I finished Queen of Shadows I was quite sure I loved her, but after reading this book I'm absolutely positive.I love the worlds Sarah J. Maas creates and I think this plot is amazing. I could've never guessed the story would end like it did. There wasn't a plot twist like in Crown of Midnight, but that was a real big plot twist and it might be hard to surpass that one, but they way the story turned out did make me gasp several times, which resulted in me getting some weird glances.If you loved the 'Throne of Glass' series, you'll love this series too.If you wasn't so sure about the 'Throne of Glass' series, you might still want to give this series a try, as the premise of this book is different from the 'Throne of Glass' series. Altough maybe you shouldn't be taking my recommendations on Sarah J. Maas' books (my babies), since I might be a little biased (*cough cough* read the first sentence of this review again).
I didn't really like this book. I don't know what it was, because all the reviews for this book are so good, everyone is raving about it. But not me. Because of all the hype surrounding this book, I was quite excited about reading this book, but I just think this wasn't for me. I just don't really like contemporaries and I keep trying, but I keep ending up not really liking them. There were moments I did enjoy the book, but there weren't many. There were some funny moments, but for me they weren't funny enough to prompt me to laugh out loud or even really bring a smile to my face (although me laughing out loud from a book is quite rare...). I did want to keep reading to the end to find out who Blue was, so I'll have to give the book that, but it was probably also the only reason I finished the book. I just think this wasn't for me, which I'm a little bit sad about, because I wanted to enjoy this book like everyone else did.
This book was dark. Somehow it's different from the other books I've read.Adelina is different from the usual YA heroine, and actually she isn't a hero at all, she's kind of a villain. She has a lot of darkness in her and some of the thoughts she has...A lot of things happened that I didn't expect at all, there were so many twists and turns, which I really like.And that ending was just intense.Oh, and of course I love Enzo. I also liked him and Adelina together. (view spoiler)[It's just a shame what happens at the end. (hide spoiler)]I realise I don't actually have a lot to say about this book, I just liked it, it was different from other YA books and very dark.
Will write down some of my thoughts later this week
THAT ENDING?!! WHAT THE HELL?!! SALLY GREEN, WHY IN THE NAME OF GOD DID YOU DO THIS TO ME?!!
I was quite disappointed when I was reading this, but that is not really the book's fault and probably more mine. Hang on, don't stop reading let me explain, because I just want to mention now that in the end I do think the plot is good and this series still has potential considering there are two more books.The biggest problem that I had with this book was that I really hated the choice of words that were used and I'm not really sure if I should blame Kerstin Gier or the translator, Merel Leene, for that. I decided to read this book in Dutch, because I thought the book is translated from German and since I can't read in German, Dutch seemed like the best option, because it is more similair to German then English and this way it would lose less of its meaning. This way I also didn't have to pay for the book (I'm a little bit short on money for books), since I could just get it from the library (there are almost no English books in my Dutch library, which is why I have to buy all of the English books I read).It has been a really long time since I've read a book that was translated in Dutch (I just read the original version if it is in English, which most of the books I read are) and I think after reading this I remember why. I don't think I can really expain it, but I just really hated the words that were used.I was really exited for the premise of this book: time traveling and romance in the past. This is basically what I grasped from the blurb from the Dutch book. If you're looking for what I just mentioned (I was looking for that too), I can already tell you the book wasn't like that, so don't get your hopes up. I think the description of the English book here on Goodreads is way better, altough that also makes the book sound way more exciting then it actually is. I hate it when the blurb mentions events that happens towards the end of the book. That was also the case for this book.Firstly, it took about a hundred pages for something really exciting to happen. I mean Gwen did go back into the past a little bit earlier in the book, but nothing exciting happened before a hundred pages had passed.After the 'exciting' event there were another hundred pages that felt like some kind of history lesson and just a lot of confusion with a lot of holes in it, since no one wanted to immediately explain everything to Gwen, so it was a bit vague. After those two hundred pages (this book is 350 pages) I felt like finally things started to kick off a bit.Only when I got to chapter 15 (page 325) some really exciting things happend, but I felt like those things were rushed and ended too quickly.So to summarise the part above, the book was quite slow without a lot of really interesting parts, almost no time travelling (in my opinion) and no romace, like I was promised.So I also wanted to mention Gwen. I felt like there were certain moments when she was really childish. There was a part (I don't remember where exactly, but it was somewhere in the middle) where she thought: I just want my mummy or something like that. When you read that you probably guess that she might be twelve, but in actual fact Gwen is sixteen and a half... Yes, didn't expect that did you. Gwen wasn't like that in the whole book, but there were some really annoying parts where she just acted like no sixteen year old ever would.I must say that there were also parts where Gwen was funny, I'll give her that.Well then, I felt like that was quite a bit of criticism. I will say that I feel like most of that criticism comes from the fact that I read this book in Dutch and that my expectations for the book were quite high and it just wasn't like I thought it was going to be.I will say again that I think the plot is good and I am interested in the other books to just see how this will all turn out, because the book definitely ended on a cliffhanger.I want to try reading this book in English, because generally almost everything sounds better in English than in Dutch, including the quotes from this book here on Goodreads. I'm just not really excited to read them and I'll first have to find the English version somewhere quite cheap, because I don't think I love this series enough that I really want to own it and reread it. Yes, I know, I have such a hard life.I hope that this review in any way makes sense, because I feel like I have just been rambling.
This book hangover is going to be pretty bad. I absolutely loved the Queen's Thief series, especially Eugenides. I'm so glad there is going to be another book (although the wait is going to be devastating since there is not even a release date yet).
I must admit, I was not overwhelmed by this book, but it did suffice my expectations. I just wished it would've blown me away a bit more. I have some things I do like about this book, but there were also a few things that weren't really great in my opinion, so here we go.Eadlyn grew up, and I think she turned out as a really nice person. A lot of people hated Eadlyn in the first book. She was really self-centered and I guess you could say she was a bit of a princess. I never really hated her, but she also wasn't my favourite person. However in this book she turned into a real queen. She accepted her faith, stepped up for her people, and became an overall nice person.Somthing that disappointed me a bit, was the length of the book. It is the shortest book of the series. I always feel like the finale to a series should be the longest book (except for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was satisfied with that). It definitely shouldn't be the shortest book. On the other hand, it was good it wasn't much longer, because otherwise it would've started to be a bit boring, which brings me onto my next point.Nothing really exciting happened that overwhelmed me. There were no big plot twists. This doesn't mean the book was bad, but I would've just liked it if there were slightly more exciting then they were.The initial thing that made me excited for The Heir and this book was to see more of America and Maxon after their marriage, having four children and just being together for a long time. So when I read The Heir, there wasn't a lot of America and Maxon, which was quite disappointing. Luckily for me, this book was filled with America and Maxon moments, which made me really happy, I love seeing (or I guess reading) how in love they still are.I didn't really like who Eadlyn ended up with, and I tought it was a little bit predictable, since I guessed it and I'm quite gullible when it comes to these things. It's not very often I predict what is going to happen correctly, just the big, general, obvious stuff that happens in the end that everyone guesses. I really wish she would've chosen someone else ((view spoiler)[Kile (hide spoiler)]), but I'm still glad Eadlyn and her new partner are happy and the person who I wanted her to end up with is happy too.I'm not so sure I liked that after the events The Heir ended with, Eadlyn had to take care of everything. I don't think it was fair to her. It was sweet Maxon cared so much, but not all the responsibilities of the country (literally) should've fallen onto Eadlyn's shoulders.The last thing is Ahren. I felt like things between him and Eadlyn were never really cleared and I just wish things were.I do think I'm going to miss this series now it's over, I have grown quite attached to the characters after five books.
I don't really know what to rate this book. I had to read it for school and I'm not sure I really liked it.Generally I'm not a really difficult person to please. If I like the plot of a book, I usually enjoy reading it, simple as that. The way things are written doesn't always do something for me. A lot of metaphors, florid writing or just plain old language, I generally don't really care. I guess you can also see that by the ratings I give on Goodreads since they're all pretty high (or I just read amazing books, that could also be the case).I did like the fact that this book is actually a play, or at least it's a script, it's not yet a play when it's written.Sometimes it was a bit difficult to keep up with the way the present and the past seamlessly knit together. I read somewhere that Willy's memories in the book were not actually like they happened, but that Willy 'changed' them. I'm not really sure about that, but I definitely don't think it helped making it easier to read. Presumably there is some kind of literature meaning behind it that I probably just don't get.Maybe I'll gain some more understanding of the book when we discuss it in class, which will hopefully make me more fond of the book.I guess right now I'm at a point in my life where I just don't really like 'real literature', as my mother would call it, yet.
You know, I really like that ending.
I had to read this book for school for French. So I was supposed to read this book in French, but I actually read it in English. I know, shame on me, but at least I understood the book this way. That is why I can admit, this book wasn't too bad.I went into this book knowing pretty much nothing. I had to read it anyway, whether I liked it or not, so why bother, right? I just knew it was about a guy, Morlac, who was locked up in prison around world war I time. And well, after reading the book, that was basically it. We don't know why Morlac was in prison at the beginning of the book. I liked following Lantier, the judge/major, investigating Morlac's case and slowly finding out what happened. And books where you slowly find out what happens are my favourite kind of books. At the end this book got quite deep when we found out Morlac's entire story. Jean-Christophe Rufin said some interesting things about the war and human nature.This book was okay, but I have to admit I'd rather I could've taken the time it took to read this book to read one of my 'own' books.
This book was pretty great. I was initially attracted to this book by the plot: Father makes a bargain with the evil ruler of the kingdom, the Gentle Lord, and gives one of his daughters to the Gentle Lord as the price. Nyx (the daughter) has been trained her whole life to take down Ignifex (the Gentle Lord). But of course, it's never that simple, because Ignifex is not what/who Nyx expected him to be. I really love Nyx and Ignifex. Nyx (whose name I also really love, by the way) is not some perfect little girl. No, she is flawed and has some dark parts, but that is what makes her human and what I like about her. At first she is wary of Ignifex (which is completely normal, considering what he has done) and even though she is scared she still decides to marry the Gentle lord and go through with the whole plan. Basically she is really brave, but she does have flaws, but that is what I like about her, it makes her more real and human. Ignifex is the witty villain of the story. Those are definitely my favourite kind of villains, and Ignifex is no exception. His snarky, sarcastic remarks (and the snarky, sarcastic remarks Nyx gives in response to Ignifex') and the way he interacts with Nyx in general. An example is the first time Nyx and Ignifex meet, that meeting was just perfect. The way Ignifex loves Nyx for who she really is, is also beautiful and something else I love. On the other hand, I did not like Shade. I didn't trust him and I liked Ignifex way better.Towards the end of the book, things did start to get a little bit vague. I like it best when things that happen in books are clear and you don't have to speculate and interpret the things yourself. The ending of this book does fall into that category, but I did still really enjoy this book. And to be honest, even though not everything was a hundred percent clear, I do think the ending was beautiful in a way. I don't know of this book deserves five stars or if four would be better, because of the ending, but I did really like the other part of the book, which is definitely the biggest part of the book. And I also really like Nyx and Ignifex, so I'm just going with the five star rating. And this book pulled me out of my reading slump, which should also counts for something.
Can we talk about 'Something Old, Something New'?! That epilogue was AMAZING. Wishing another epilogue would come out after that ending...Okay, so let's talk about the other novellas, because I think you can guess which one was my favourite. I didn't think all the novellas were great. For example 'The Keeper' didn't really do much for me and I tought it was kind of slow. And at first I didn't get the ending of 'The Little Android', but that one is probably on me, since I also initially thought this novella was about Iko... Once I did get the ending I do think it was a good ending and I think the right thing happened.Me thinking the novellas weren't all spectacular doesn't mean I didn't like them, I just didn't absolutely love all of them.Overall I think this book is a good addition to the series and I did really like reading more about all the characters I've come to love.
“I didn't want to wake up. I was having a much better time asleep. And that's really sad. It was almost like a reverse nightmare, like when you wake up from a nightmare you're so relieved. I woke up into a nightmare.”This book is about Craig who suffers from depression. When he tries to commit suicide, he checks himself into a mental hospital. I think Ned Vizzini explained how it feels to be depressed very well, which is not very strange considering he was depressed himself and spent five days in a mental hospital too. If you want to gain more insight in how it feels to be depressed or you know someone who has depression, you should definitely read this book. Even though not everyone with depression suffers from the same symptoms as Craig does in this book, like wanting to kill yourself and having trouble eating, but the general, main thought and feeling is there.On the one hand I kind of want to compare this book to a John Green book, because the writing is very similair. The simple, easy going and funny writing style. The story however is different from the stories John Green has written.I can't give this book five stars, because Part 2: How I got there, in which Craig explains how he got depressed, was in my opinion a bit slow and it was about seventy pages from the 444. Please don't let this discourage you though!“See, when you mess something up, you learn for the next time. It's when people compliment you that you're in trouble. That means they expect you to keep it up.”
The art style is very beautiful and I loved it. The story was interesting, but I didn't feel like the things that happened were always explained very well. Maybe it's just because I don't read a lot of graphic novels, but I was confused at times.
Wow, this was everything I could have expected from this book and more.This was just great, I don't really need to say anything more about it, I just loved it.Still kind of wishing I could make an exception and give this book six stars, because it was even better than Cinder and Scarlet, but I couldn't know Cress and this book would be even better than them, so five stars will have to do.I'm going to miss all these characters, particularly Thorne.Now I'm really excited to read Stars Above, especially the epilogue!
I’m a little bit disappointed in this last book. There was just so much going on in this book. Everyone goes on their own quests and it just makes it so confusing. I just kind of lost the thread at times. Especially when I put the book down and picked it up again later, I just couldn’t keep up with what everyone was doing. The ending felt rushed to me. I expected just expected something bigger. Something that would blow my socks off. Something fitting for the end of a series. And unfortunately we just didn’t get that.
Well, that sure was something.I'm still not sure if I should give this book four or five stars, but we're just going to go with five, because the end definitely made up for the things I didn't like.So the first hunderd pages, I don't really want to say it, but I honestly couldn't care less and I was even a little bored.I didn't really like Sydney and I felt like nothing really happened.The next two hundred pages were a lot better.I liked meeting Dimitri's family (is that a spoiler?) and Sydney started to grow on me.When we reached the 300 page mark, things really started to kick off. (view spoiler)[ “Roza." His voice had that same wonderful lowness, the same accent . . . it was all just colder. "You forgot my first lesson: Don’t hesitate.” (hide spoiler)]And let me tell you, it was really intense. There was so much at stake (I'm sorry couldn't pass up that opportunity for that horrible pun. I've noticed the Vampire World has a lot of opportunities for great puns.)There is somthing though that is still not really clear to me: (view spoiler)[the whole Avery thing. What exactly was that all about and what was her deal? I felt like she was just a way to make things back at the Academy more exciting and I think that is a shame. (hide spoiler)]And I never expected this:(view spoiler)[ "Oh God," I said. "I'm Zmey's daughter. Zmey Junior. Zymette, even." (hide spoiler)]And I think I like it.
So I think I finally gathered all my thoughts on this book. I did genuinely enjoy reading this book and the rest of the series and I really do like the storyline. It was also better than the second book, The Wicked Will Rise. I just have one big problem with it, I feel like the series is just dragging on and on. Don't get me wrong I do really like this series, but I think I was ready for it to end. I feel like there is something fishy going on behind the scenes. There are already three books, six novellas, another novella is coming and then the the fourth book is being written. They are just trying to make money of this series now. I don't think the author has anything to do with this, but I'm not quite sure who 'they' are. I really think this is a shame and I hope Danielle Paige is being treated fairly.I liked that in this book Amy went back to Kansas. It was interesting to see how things were going on after the hurricane there. And of course that ending...I will read the next book and I'm quite curious to see how the plot will develop in it. I hope I won't be very dissapointed.
I have some of my thoughts about this book written down, but never actually wrote a review, because I was on holiday and didn't have an internet connection. I might still do it, but I'm not sure considering I read this book 3 months ago now... I'll see.

I wasn't sure about The Raven Boys and I'm also not sure about this book.I felt like there were a couple similarities (kind of) between the books.In The Raven Boys I didn't really like Adam's point of view, in this book it's Ronan's. I don't really know what about his point of view it was, but there was something. And his dreams... They were really messed up and dark. Towards the end of the book I did start to like him though.And towards the end I also started to like Adam more. He was still the same as in The Raven Boys, but towards the end that started to change.In The Raven Boys I hated Barrington Whelk, in this book initially I thought that I would hate the Gray Man (because I thought they were alike), so I didn't like him in the beginning. But boy, was I wrong. He is actually one of my favourite characters now. And towards the end of the book I even felt sorry for him.Who I did kind of hate was Kavinsky. Yes, I'll admit I do think some of the things he said/did were funny, but I didn't like the other parts of him (that sounds weird, like I'm talking about body parts, but I don't know how the rephrase that sentence).(view spoiler)[And I also think that him dying is an easy fix to the problem of too much dreaming. I was slightly dissappointed by that. (hide spoiler)]Okay onto more positive things.I have a new appreciation for Maura, Calla and Persephone. I already liked them in The Raven Boys, but now I think I love them. Some of the things they did...Everyone in this book was so sassy and sarcastic, which I just love.And wow, that ending was intense. So many things were going on. But why do all these books have to end on these cliffhangers?And I'm still definitely rooting for Blue and Gansey, I just love them together.So, one more thing. It is kind of a spoiler for The Raven Boys, so don't read this next part if you haven't read it yet.(view spoiler)[I don't understand why Adam's deaf ear isn't mentioned more. I mean it is a pretty serious thing, so why isn't it talked about more in the book? (hide spoiler)]
Review to come! I'm still a mess right now...
After about a hundred pages I almost stopped reading this book, because I was pretty bored with it, but I am so glad I kept going.Let's start from the beginning.I was pretty sure I was going to enjoy this book, because there was a swear word within the first five pages. I live in the Netherlands where swearing isn't that big of a deal, so maybe that has something to do with it, but I also feel like it makes the book feel more real and honest, because let's be honest, everyone swears.It was also giving of a Harry Potter/Hogwarts feeling, which I liked in the beginning. But when I started to get a bit bored with the book it got annoying, because I couldn't stop comparing this world to the Harry Potter world. But fortunately in the end I could let it go (*cue the Frozen song* (no, actually don't)).In the first 'book' aka part (I always feel like it's a bit weird to have books within a book, but okay) Simon got back at Watford and he finds out his roommate Baz did not come back. Basically for the whole 'book' (aka part) Simon was set on finding Baz. In fact he was so set on finding him, Simon would roam the school at night, when he should be sleeping. It felt like it was an obesession, in a bad way. Oh, and to make it even weirder, had I already mentioned the fact they were archenemies?Then I finally made it to 'book' two and that's when things finally started kicking off for me because *warning, minor spoiler* Baz returned. And man, do I love Baz. He reminded me of Jace from the Mortal Instrument series and Will Herondale from the Infernal Devices series (two characters I absolutely love, by the way), because they all seem sarcastic and snarky from the outside, but are actually really sensitive on the inside.Something else that bothered me was that I felt like we missed out on all the action. First example is when we got some vague details about Simon's encounter with the Humdrum, who is the magic worlds biggest threat and Simon is the one who is supposed to slay him. Then when Simon is on his way to school he gets attacked by a goblin and all the action is about one page. And when Simon gets attacked by bugs with a really weird and long name, we only hear about it afterward. When we find out why Baz had not come to school on time, we once again missed all the action and only get to hear the story afterwards. Then the last thing I disliked were the spells. I thought they were a bit trite and not very original, but I have to admit, in the end they started growing on me.I feel like I've just focused on all the bad things now, so I should say something positive, because I did really like this book. So let's focus on the positive things.I really liked the map and the illustrations at the beginning of each of the 'books'.There were some good twists in the plot. Although I have to admit I saw a few of the coming, but they were good nonetheless.And I think this book is helping me get out of that hole that is my reading slump. When I finished this book I caught myself thinking about wanting to read this book a few times, but sadly at that point there was no more book left for me to read.Have I said enough positive things yet to actually make it sound like I really enjoyed this book? Because I truly did.I don't really know how to end this, so I'm ending with this:Baz and Simon. Yes. I ship it. Hard.
Lately when I've been reading books I've been underlining quotes I really like and putting in sticky notes at those parts. If I would've done that for this book I would've had to put sticky notes on nearly every page and underline almost everything. If that doesn't explain how good this book is, I don't know what will.I am going through quite a tough time myself right now with depression and I feel like Matt Haig understands what people with depression are going through, which is not very weird considering Matt Haig had depression too.Of course I couldn't identify with everything Matt Haig wrote about, because (as he also mentioned in his book: “MINDS ARE UNIQUE. They go wrong in unique ways. My mind went wrong in a slightly different way to how other minds go wrong. Our experience overlaps with other people's, but it is never exactly the same experience.”) everyone's experience with deprssion is different. People have different symptoms and they deal with it differently. But I do think Matt Haig got the general stuff exactly as it is.This book is not just great because Matt Haig knows what other people with depression go through, it's also the way he wrote about depression. I think he really got the essence of it right, which will help people understand what it is like having depression.That's why I definitely recommend this book to everyone, because I think everyone will in one way or another deal with depression in their lives. You will either suffer through it yourself or you will know someone who will suffer/has suffered from depression. Both ends of the spectrum are difficult to be on, especially because there is such a huge taboo around depression, but I think this book can help with that."Even more staggeringly, depression is a disease so bad that people are killing themselves because of it in a way they do not kill themselves with any other illness. Yet people still don’t really think depression really is that bad. If they did, they wouldn't say the things they say."The book is a good mix between Matt Haig's own life and other stuff. He talks (or rather writes) about his own life and own experiences with depression. I don't really know how to describe the other stuff, so I'm just going to leave some of the chapter's titles here, so you can figure it out:'A conversation across time'Here the past Matt Haig talks to the present Matt Haig.'Things depression says to you''Reasons to stay alive'This is probably my favourite chapter. I'll talk about it more in a bit.'How to be there for someone with depression or anxiety''Things people say to depressives that they don't say in other life-threatening situations'I first came across this book when I was watching videos on YouTube. I've been watching Will Darbyshire's (who makes great videos and actually also has depressions) videos for quite a while now, when a video Reasons to stay alive (click the link!) popped up in my subscription box, naturally I watched it and I actually cried. I'm not really a crier, but this video made me cry. The video is about the chapter 'Reasons to stay alive' in the book. Will took five of the the points and made a great video about it. When I read the book and came across this chapter I actually cried again (especially point 10, which is point 5 in Will's video).So if you want to get a feel for this book, watch Will's video. And if you've already read the book, watch Will's video.
Wow, Cassandra Clare has done it once again. The Shadowhunter Chronicles are probably my favourite series and now this one can join them (I guess it already has since it's a part of The Shadowhunter Chronicles, but whatever).I love how Cassandra Clare throws hints at you while you're reading the book, but they don't make any sense yet. And then when you get to the ending those hints string together into a beautifully orchestrated plot(twist)/ending.I love Emma and Julian and seeing some characters from The Mortal Instruments return in this series.You don't really need to read the other books of The Shadowhunter Chronicles first, because I think enough explanation is given about the Shadowhunter world to understand everything. You will however read some spoilers about The Mortal Instruments Series, so I guess keep that in mind if you don't read the other books first.I can't wait for the rest of the series!
Usually when you read a book you have some idea of where the plot is going, what is going to happen in the end or who are going to end up together. In this book however I was in the dark for a great part of the book, and I think that is something that makes a book a really good book. And Adelina, I thought she was dark in The Young Elites, but it pales in comparison to how she is in this book. And I like it, because it is different form other YA books, because Adelina is no heroine. And sometimes it's also just fun to be on the dark side. Everything is just so intense in these books, the end battle, yep...Although I must admit I did feel like some parts of the book were a little bit slow. Oh, and I also love Magiano.
I want to start of by saying I had to read this book for school and I don't generally enjoy the books I have to read for school. Having said that, there were definitely parts of this book I liked, but also parts I didn't like. That's why I'm kind of stumped when it comes to rating the books I need to read for school. I don't want to give it a low rating just because right now I didn't really enjoy everything. Currently I don't enjoy reading this kind of book ('real literature' as my mother sometimes calls it) and if it weren't for school, I probably wouldn't have picked this book up. However, this doesn't mean it's a bad book. And yes, I do realise that the rating is my own opinion, but I think the problem I have is giving a low rating to a book I do realise is a good book.This probably doesn't make a lot of sense, but I don't know how to say it differently... I'm sorry.Okay, I'll stop rambling about ratings now.Something I did really like about the book was Part 1. I liked reading about Winston's everyday life in the world George Orwell has created. I especially like chapter IV, the chapter in which we learn more about Winston's job. The concept of 'the mutability of the past' is so bizarre to me. Even though there are parts of the world where things like this still happen, which also is odd to me, normally you don't really think about things like that (or at least I don't).I also liked George Orwell's writing style. His lack of metaphors, similes and other stylistic devices and his use of easy, plain English is somthing I appreciate. It makes it way easier to understand.Something I really didn't like about the book was 'the book' (that sentence is quite weird if you haven't read 1984). I read it (obviously because I had to), but I was just reading the words. Nothing really registered in my brain. If you ask me to give you the main gist of it, I can't. It also didn't help it was so long. It is probably really interesting, but not for me right now.Looking back on it I am glad I read this. I mean I definitely learned things from it especially now I've had to do some research and we talked about in class a bit.Sometimes it is just difficult whilst reading the book, because naturally I won't understand all the allusions that are made and I won't have all the background information I need. So I'll have to go to some kind of website like SparkNotes to gain a better understanding of het book, which is not really a problem, but can be a bit inconvenient at times.
This book was so, so good! I absolutely loved it.I think the best way I can describe this book is intense. Basically from the first chapter until the last page the story was intense. This also made me want to keep reading, because I needed to know what was going to happen.Every character had so many secrets and I loved it. And when I say everyone had at least one big secret, I literaly mean eveyone. From the beginning you only knew Laia's and Elias' secrets, since you read from their point of views, but throughout the story everyone's secrets started slowly unraveling.This is also great for when you reread the book, because then you can see all the tiny hints that were being dropped, but you didn't understand/see, because you didn't yet know what the secret was.Wow, and the Commandant, she was something. The best way to describe her is just that she's a bitch, it's as simple as that. The things she did, they were intense... Everytime Laia did something that the Commandant wouldn't approve of, I was so scared the Commandant would do something horrible to Laia (or to Kitchen-Girl and Cook, for that matter).I also really liked Laia and Elias and I'm definitely rooting for them, I want them to be together. (view spoiler)[Keenan (hide spoiler)] (not even sure if that's really a spoiler, but better save than sorry) wasn't my favourite character and I do like Helene, but I'd like it more if Elias and Laia end up together.The only teeny tiny thing I don't like is the blurb. I know that probably isn't Sabaa Tahir's fault, because she probably didn't write it, but I still want to mention it. On the back of the book it says: 'He and Laia will soon realize that their destinies are intertwined'. In my opinion the 'soon' part is not completely true. When Laia arrives at Blackcliff Academy it takes quite a while before Laia and Elias meet. And I feel like the part where they 'realize that their destinies are intertwined' only happens at the end of the book.Nonetheless, as I already mentioned this is not probably Sabaa Tahir's doing. It's just a pet peeve of mine when the blurb of the book is not completely truthful or if it mentions things that only happen at the end of the book, just to make the book sound more exciting.I just thought this book was great, and I cannot wait for A Torch Against the Night, I'm so excited.
THAT ENDING WRECKED ME SO THOROUGHLY. HOLY SHIT.It was like Sarah J. Maas took my heart out of my chest, stomped on it with her foot and then proceeded to put it back in my chest.Do I have your attention now? Great, because you need to read this book. It is absolutely amazing and I'm going to tell you why.I freaking loved this book and there were so many things I liked about it, so I am going to pick a few and completely fangirl about them. Because if we really want to talk about all the things I liked, you're better off just reading the whole book. I stuck about fifty sticky notes in the book at parts or quotes I liked (if you want some idea of it, read my status updates, there are a lot of them...), so really there wouldn't be enough space in this review.I will have to warn you in advance, there might be some spoilers if you haven't read until at least Heir of Fire (view spoiler)[you know, the basics: Celaena being Aelin (hide spoiler)]. I will hide all the other spoilers from Empire of Storms, so if you've read up and until Heir of Fire, you're probably save.Just a little tip before we begin, read The Assassin's Blade before reading this book if you haven't read it yet.God, I ramble too much let's get on with me rambling some more about the book.It's now been almost a month since I read this (I'll be rereading this very soon, because I'm definitely not over it yet), so excuse me if I forgot anything vital, but I just really wanted to write this review now and I honestly tried my hardest.Okay, now we'll start for real. I think everyone already stopped reading after all that boring stuff...1) Starting it off with a spoiler, great start... (view spoiler)[Elide and Lorcan, or I guess Elorcan. I ship it. Hard. I don't even exactly know what it is about them, but from what I've seen, almost everyone ships them. God, I really want this to happen, even though after that ending, I'm not completely sure anymore. (hide spoiler)]2) Elide. I didn't give her enough credit. I did not foresee she would be so smart and brave, and I want to apologise to her, because she is awesome. And I hated seeing how much she doubted her usefulness.3) Manon. I have to admit, but I wasn't the biggest fan of Manon's story in Heir of Fire and I just read through those chapters to get back to Celaena. I started warming up to her a bit more in Queen of Shadows, although I was still reading the chapters just to get back to Aelin as quickly as possible. But in this book, holy shit. Manon, (view spoiler)[standing up to her grandmother, I lived for that, because I honestly wasn't sure if she would choose her Grandmother or Asterin (hide spoiler)]. And that plot twist (view spoiler)[Manon being the last Crochan queen (hide spoiler)] holy shit, I did not see that one coming. 4) Rowaelin, I live for them. I want a Rowan (or a Rhys). Shit, I love them and I don't have anything more to say about it. And that ending (view spoiler)[they are fucking mates and married (hide spoiler)] *cries* (read point 9 for more on that).5) Elide getting her period. I live for characters in books having 'real people' problems, especially fantasy novels. (view spoiler)[And when Lorcan cut up his shirt for Elide, that warmed my heart. (hide spoiler)]I also loved it when Celaena first got her period in Throne of Glass and I silently cheer everytime a character has to go to the toilet. Man, I live for that stuff (I've already said that phrase too often in this review).6) Lysandra and Aedion. I love them together, I love them as separate characters and I love them with Aelin. I think I've said enough. Oh, and Aedion and (view spoiler)[Gavriel, his father (hide spoiler)]. Yeah, I liked that too.7) Fenrys, I almost forgot about him, how could I? I love Fenrys. He reminds me of Cassian and Rhys from A Court of Mist and Fury. Rhys and Fenrys, I think you get why. And Cassian and Fenrys' sense of humor is so similar, and to clarify, I love their sense of humor. Oh, and Fenrys can fucking (view spoiler)[winnow (hide spoiler)].8) The way Sarah J. Maas weaves her plot. Throughout the book, you don't get answers to all the questions you have, but at the end, Sarah J. Maas takes all the loose ends, the ends you had forgotten about and even the ends you didn't know were loose ends and she just takes them and weaves them into this beautiful, intricate, clever story. Sarah J. Maas, how do you even do this? I don't understand what must be going in her brains to create these stories so beautifully as she does.9) And then finally that fucking ending. Holy shit, I was sobbing. I don't often cry when reading books, but I was bawling my eyes out with this one. It even got difficult to read the pages. I cried more at the ending of this book then at the ending of Me Before You. Referring back to point 8, I don't even know how Sarah J. Maas did this. She has been fricking thinking about this since the beginning I guess, and she has been weaving it into the whole plot since Heir of Fire. I don't feel like we think about that enough, so let's take a moment to think about it and appreciate everything that Sarah J. Maas is and does.On to some more spoilery stuff for everyone that read the book: (view spoiler)[ I cannot deal with the fact that Aelin and Rowan were mates from the fucking beginning and Lyria wasn't even fucking supposed to be in the picture. Fuck. Maeve, holy shit your plan, was so wicked and you've been planning it for so long. If I wasn't on Aelin's side, I might've been on your side, because fuck that plan. I'm speechless. Aelin being taken away in a fucking iron coffin. Fenrys still being bound to Maeve and maybe he has to do some terrible things in the next book to Aelin, I cannot physically think about that yet. Maeve having Cairn whip, I repeat WHIP, Aelin. Rowan finding out Aelin was taken and going off to find her. And how do I even forget the fact Rowan and Aelin married, so Rowan is fucking king/prince of Terrasen And to top it all off Lysandra pretending to be Aelin when all of Aelin's old friends arrived... Oh and I haven't even mentioned Aelin (or Dorian) has to fucking die to send Erawan away and seal the Wyrdgates. Elena messed up big time (hide spoiler)]Okay, I'm just stopping here even though I have 9 points and 10 would look better. If I haven't convinced you to read it yet, I don't know how I can do it, just read it. I mean, have you looked at the rating, it's so high, which makes me incredibly happy.Sorry for swearing so much in this review, but I just cannot contain myself about this fucking (here we go again, when I've just apologised...) book.If you want another review of someone who has a very similar opinion as me about the Throne of Glass series (and the A Court of Thons and Roses series for that matter) and who talked about this book in probably a much clearer way than I did you should try Piéra Forde's review on YouTube, I also absolutely love her other reviews, her channel and her as a person in general.This is probably the longest review I've ever written. I've written more than a 1000 words... I feel like I've written some kind of book really short book, so it feels appropriate to dedicate this review (I'm sorry this just got really weird, I don't know why I do these weird things) to my friend Iris, who I've finally convinced to read this book (she has already read the rest of the Throne of Glass series save for Queen of Shadows), but I mean I need someone to talk (and scream) to about this book and I'm hoping this review has convinced her to read it even more.And if you were still doubting this book, I hope I also convinced you to read this.If you've come all the way to this point of the review, congratulations, 10 points to you. You deserve it, because you made it all the way to the end of this review.
If you ever decide to read anything by William Shakespeare I cannot recommend getting the SparkNotes No Fear Shakespeare editions enough (they have one for every play, not just Othello). It's true what they say, you don't have to fear William Shakespeare if you read the book this way. You can understand the book now, yay! You'll also get plenty of helpful comments on, for example, the slang used in William Shakespeare's time. Did you know that when someone was talking about a 'thing', he was actually talking about a woman's private parts? No? Well, thanks to SparkNotes you will (and of course that is everything you ever wished for, I understand).Wow, I don't think it has ever taken me this long to read a book. Almost two and a half months has to be a record. It wasn't even that the plot was very boring, so I don't really know what it was. Probably that I had to read this for school and I could find so many other excuses to not read it. I had my IB exam/commentary today though, so now I had to finish it. Sadly, I got this book to comment on (I could've gotten passages from two other books too, but with my luck, of course I get the book I was dreading to get the most), and I of course did not get the modern day English translation I had in this SparkNotes version, so I did not understand most of what was going on in the passage I got, but oh well, that's life (*deep metaphor*).
I am just not sure about this book. There were things I really liked, but also things I didn't really.Let's start with Blue. I loved Blue, I love her personality and she's just a great person. I also loved her life at Fox Way 300, I love all the people that live there.I also really loved it when she was together with the Raven Boys, when the whole gang is together (I also include Maura, Calla and Persephone into that). In my opinion those were some of the best parts of the book. The way they all interacted with each other was great. I love how Blue was taken up into the group so easily, even though she is so different from the Raven Boys, which is also something that makes it funny.(I realise I used the word 'love' a lot in that paragraph, I'm sorry)I wasn't too keen on Adam's point of view. The first thing I realised about Gansey, Ronan, Adam and Noah is that they were all so broken and kind of messed up, especially Adam. I didn't really like some of the ideas he had on certain things, which did make me pity him, but it didn't make it enjoyable for me to read from his point of view.Gansey's point of view on the other hand, I did like. Altough I did kind of have to figure him out in the beginning.The whole Glendower thing. I will admit, it wasn't very clear to me in the beginning and actually right now I'm still not really sure if it is. I think I do get the main gist of it though. I think with these books you just need to accept that not everything will be crystal clear and that you need to interpret some things yourself.I also hated Barrington Whelk. I don't know what exactly it is, but I really didn't like him.One last thing I didn't like is the tagline: 'If you kiss your true love, he will die'. So, yes, the tagline applies to Blue, but is it the main thing the book was about? In my opinion, no. Sure, it is part of it, because Blue meets the Raven Boys and I think you can guess what happens, but it isn't the main thing. This is probably not Maggie Stiefvater's doing, but I still wanted to mention it, because I think it is annoying.Oh, and I wanted to mention I'm all aboard the Blue and Gansey ship.
There's not much to say. This was as amazing as Cinder. I flew through these books, the story is just amazing.I really like how it is based on fairytales, but when you read them they don't have that fairytale feel to them. And why is no one talking about Thorne? I absolutely love him, he cracks me up. I think he and Kai are definetely my favourite characters.
This was good. Even though I didn't enjoy reading all the novellas equally, I loved reading about Celeana and seeing how she was before she goes to Endovier and to see how it changed me. The Assassin and the Desert is probably my favourite of the bunch. And oh my god, one sentence on page 372 (in the edition I have of course) absolutely shatterd my heart, and of course the ending also did even when I knew what was coming. I Recommend this to everyone who loves the Throne of Glass series and wants more insight in Celeana's life.
HOLY SHIT THIS WAS AMAZING.Okay, so now that is out of the way. I don't even know where to begin this review. My thoughts and emotions are still so messed up from finishing this book. Well, it probably also wasn't the smartest idea to review this book an hour after I finished.Let's begin this review with Feyre. Oh my god, that character development was great. I like that this book doesn't so much revolve around romance as A Court of Thorns and Roses does. This book is more about Feyre finding out who she is. She has been broken by the events of Under the Mountain. And if you tell yourself that you wouldn't be broken by that as Feyre is, you're lying to yourself.I also am amazed at how I could dislike someone in A Court of Thorns and Roses and then fall so in love with them in this book. The opposite of this applies to another character. I think you can guess who I'm talking about for both cases if you've read the books, but I don't want to spoil anything in case you haven't read the book yet. And if that is the case ask yourself what you're doing here and not reading A Court of Mist and Fury.This book was definitely a ride, because so much happened. At first I was just sad and angry for Feyre, but that changed quite quickly when a special someone reappeared in her life, who made Feyre (and me to be honest) happy again.And that ending, I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. Waiting a full year will be some kind of torture.Can we also talk about the cover of this book? Because that blue colour is just perfection and the colour it is here on Goodreads doesn't do it justice.And my oh my, to end this review I'll leave this spoiler here:(view spoiler)['"And she is the High Lady of the Night Court."' (hide spoiler)]*cries*Okay, and maybe this one, because it broke me:(view spoiler)[ '"Where is she?" Amren demanded.' (hide spoiler)]*Dies a little inside*Alright, one last thing, I promise.(view spoiler)[ Rhys' story about the part where he explains when he found out Feyre was his mate shattered my heart a little too. But I can't quote it , because it is way too long. (hide spoiler)]Now I'll probably mope around for a week or so (okay, let's be honest, probably longer), because I just can't get over how wonderful this book was.
Why do all these books have these cliffhangers? This one doesn't outdo Shadow Kiss' ending, but it definitely comes in second place. I guess I'm also lucky since I'm reading the Vampire Academy series after all the books have come out, because I don't now if I could've waited for Last Sacrifice to come our after that ending. This was once again very intense, so much happened (I feel like I've said that about all these books). And I basically loved all of it. I just think there weren't enough Adrian moments considering the circumstances, but then again I might be a bit too obsessed/in love with him. Still don't understand why I don't see anyone talking about him.
I can't stop reading. I've been sucked (still going strong with that horrible pun) into this world. Someone please send help.This was definitely as good as Vampire Academy.I liked that most of the book took place somewhere else than the academy, this way we got more of a glimpse of how life outside the academy is. And this way we met Adrian, which is also very important.Still absolutely love Rose, although she did change, but she changed in a good way. She got more mature. (view spoiler)[I mean how she told Dimitri he should go with Tasha, that's some good character development right there. (hide spoiler)]Lissa also sort of grew on me, but I also think because they now knew her deal, they were able to help her with the problems she had. Wow, that was very vague, I'm sorry.And that ending? Yes, that was very very intense and sad.Okay and then Adrian. Oh god, yes Adrian. Don't worry, I like you even if all the others are not so sure. I got your back buddy.
An important lesson can be learned from this book that I absolutely agree with. You are in no way able to know everything that is going on in someone's life. Even if you are their best friend, you won't know everything there thinking, doing or even not doing. And you have to realise that your actions can impact someone's life immensely.During reading this I found two quotes that I think sum the message of this book up, so I thought I'd leave them here, because they can explain the message way better than I can.“You don’t know what goes on in anyone’s life but your own. And when you mess with one part of a person’s life, you’re not messing with just that part. Unfortunately, you can’t be that precise and selective. When you mess with one part of a person’s life, you’re messing with their entire life. Everything. . . affects everything.”And this quote from a interview with Jay Asher that was included in the edition of the book I have (the silver Penguin edition). This is part of his answer to the question "Do you feel you were trying to put across a certain message with this book?":"Basically, even though Hannah admits that the decision to take her life was entirely her own, it's also important to be aware of how we treat others. Even though someone appears to shrug off a sideways comment or to not be affected by a rumor, it's impossible to know everything else going on in that person's life, and how we might be adding to his/her pain. People do have an impact on the lives of others; that's undeniable."
The beginning was a bit slow, but after that... Wow, just wow. I couldn’t stop reading. So much was happening. This was amazing.
This was so good! I mean I read this book in two days, what more do I need to say?When I first picked this book up, I wasn't sure about it, because it was a retelling of Cinderella. But I was so wrong... I feel like it is a subtle retelling. Things like the ball and a terrible stepmother and stepsisters were in there, but Cinder wasn't really like Cinderella in my opinion, which I liked. It's not a really girly story about princesses, it's way cooler than that.I do think the plottwist was a bit predictable, since I guessed it relatively early in the book, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good plottwist.And Kai, oh my god. I absolutely love him.I'm off now, I NEED to read the next book!
thanks Camus for fighting the absurd x
Honorable meeting with a guy named Roquentin who is finding life and the things around him very odd, superfluous even, sometimes resulting in a state of being called 'Nausea'. Life for him is just an accumulation of moments with no coherenct that the human mind usually gives to it;"Nothing happens while you live. The scenery changes, people come in and go out, that’s all.There are no beginnings. Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason, an interminable,monotonous addition."The essence of life for Roquentin, is the contingency of it. How much empty he feels, he very much lives in the present moment though, but in an ungrounded manner. Roquentin describes his life very 'phenomonological' ; he perceives things just as things, which can be quite uncomforting at times. He writes: "And then all of a sudden, there it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost the harmless look of an abstract category: it was the very paste of things, this root was kneaded into existence. Or rather the root, the park gates, the bench, the sparse grass, all that had vanished: the diversity of things, their individuality, were only an appearance, a veneer. This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous masses, all in disorder—naked, in a frightful, obscene nakedness."Worht mentioning as well is the way in which Roquentin looks to portraitpaintings in a museum, the life he brings to those simple paintings which I usually saw as utterly boring. I agree with the latter that this book contains too much 'useless' information. It would have suit Roquentin if he filled his diary with his view towards life and the world a bit more. The first part was really tough. Which doesn't come as a surprise, as he writes himself: "I do not need to make phrases. I write to bring certain circumstances to light. Beware of literature. I must follow the pen, without looking for words."Most of all this book is about all the masks which we put on to escape from the absurd naked reality of the oddness of life - in this sense Roquentins boring writings were just another mask.
Some character development would have made it much better
If L'etranger is about the Absurd , La peste about Revolt, then La chute must be about resignation: God is dead and one is guilty and thus not free, no matter what: this is what one realises after 'the fall'. The best one can do is to admit its sins/guiltyness, so that one can afford everything in life without being laughed at. In other words: so that one can enjoy life with a false belief of being free.This last literary work of Camus is rather confusing content wise, but fortunately embedded in a strict formal structure. For me it seems like Camus tried too many things content-wise in just 150 pages, while his other 'novels' circle much clearer around one centeal theme. Jean-Baptiste is a person full of paradoxes. He is questioning life, hoping the reader will do the same, though I'm just mostly left questioning the novel itself, not my actual life.
Good observations about how modern society strives controllability at all levels - while life is uncertain and determined, thus uncontrollable. Really good observations written clearly, the conclusion is just a bit cut-off.
What's so special about this..?

The Waste Land is a poem that makes no sense. Eliot jumps from topic to topic, stringing together mundane anecdotes and references to epic literature; natural and urban symbolism; the colloquial and the classical. The transitions between these themes are often jarring: the ‘seams’ of the poem are visible, as if it has been written by an amateur. However, the quality of the fragments on their own, taken as self-contained units, is undeniable, betraying that they have, in fact, been written by a master. The introduction shows that ever since its release, there has been a debate about whether there is an underlying structure beneath the incongruous fragments of The Waste Land: does Eliot speak with one voice? Or, in other words, can all the voices of The Waste Land be reduced to a single one? I don’t believe it can be. I view The Waste Land as an anthology within a poem—there are many poems inside of it. It is a like a mosaic. Neither containing an underlying grand story or theme, nor any systematicity. Yet, every part contributes to creating the whole. None of the tensions or contradictions in The Waste Land are resolved: the distinction between ‘high’ and ‘low’ culture is not so much collapsed, as it is heightened. The fragments do not melt into each other, or cannot even be understood with reference to each other. Cryptic lines remain cryptic even after having read the poem (13 pages) more than a dozen times. So why should one bother with The Waste Land?I think the only way of reading The Waste Land that is worth it, is without trying to make sense of it. I dislike the approach of ‘finding’ meaning in the poem by trying to reconstruct an original story through taking certain passages as key, and understanding the rest of the text through it. I also dislike the approach of ‘positing’ meaning by interpreting the poem as being completely symbolic and imposing a certain framework on it to translate this symbolism into a concrete understanding.Of course, both of these approaches are to some extent unavoidable because one has to ground their interpretation in the text while simultaneously being able to only approach this text from a certain perspective. Leaving aside which one of these should take primacy over the other, I think the main insight is that both assume that the poem in its current form is incomplete, a puzzle whose parts need to be rearranged by the reader to form a complete picture. Here, understanding is understood as a dialectical process between interpreter and text. Meaning is not simply there already but has to be produced through the process of interpretation.I think that this assumption closes the poem off, because it precludes engagement with the poem in and on its own terms. The Waste Land itself is reduced to being a replica of some ideal form of the poem, which can only be reconstructed with the help of the reader. Instead, I think we should open the poem up: The Waste Land is a poem that makes no sense, and that is its intention. What I mean is that taken as a whole, it does not make sense because there is no coherence between its parts. However, individual fragments do make sense on their own. When I read The Waste Land, I am not reading The Waste Land but many different Waste Lands. I think that what makes it worth reading is that it plays with our ability to understand it, ever-evading our attempt to grasp it. Reading it is an exercise in futility, trying to understand something that is located at the edge of understandability. But, I think the whole point is that we cannot understand everything in the poem, and that we should not be afraid of not understanding it. . . .favorite passage:‘What shall I do now? What shall I do?’‘I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street‘With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?‘What shall we ever do?’
The book is, in my opinion not very well-written, but contains the best advice that anyone can give you these days. A must read.
** spoiler alert ** A book for young people!From the perspective of an adult reader: we all have the potential of becoming savages under the right circumstances, even as children - and will kill eachother for food, out of necessity or some will purely for entertainment or the struggle for power. Please save yourself this horrific read, filled with mundane conversations with a crux that will only make the utter naive of minds shudderFrom an educational perspective: if you want to teach young people about the crux written above, great! I think it is important to be exposed to the true nature of humankind (at the appropriate age) to let children grow into healthy adults with realistic core cognitions.
4,5/5And what horrifyingly well-verbalized actualities (2022AD) does this absolute work of art contain, with regards to the basic human rights in the female sphere of life, which is a concern to us all.
5/5 for Adventures in Wonderland, 3/5 for Through the Looking glass, which I quit reading because I could not handle the complete absence of any form of solid ground any more.
Unbelievably majestic
Having read Knausgårds' newest book "The Morning Star", I was completely mesmerized by his writingstyle and the sumbliminal storyline. The detailed regressions (which I learned is part of his style) somehow interweaved beautifully and never bored me; the exact opposite of this book.The first 250 pages are quite interesting, where the dynamic of the forbidden relationship the teacher Henrik has with one of his students, and you keep on wondering how this dynamic will evolve and how the story will unfold... a hard topic to write about, which I can respect.Only to regress into numerous flat, uninterestering storylines about the family history of Henrik and different ramblings on philosophical, theological, and historical topics which absolutely have nothing to do with the story and whose only function seem to be to give you an insight inside the socially anxious, continiously overworrying and very-quick-to-anger mind of the main character. I will strongly advise you to read The Morning Star by Knausgård, which is a true masterpiece, unlike this book.
Alle lof aan J.K. Rowling
Nogal surrealistisch
This book describes a sunny sunday afternoon in the sixties in Amsterdam. The playful and airy writing gives a surprisingly fun turn to balance out the more serious theme of the "lost generation" after WW2.
Bildungsroman in four parts, Jane Eyre is exploring the optimal conditions in which a strong female protagonist can & can't grow. Many points for interweaving just the right amount of that Brontë sense for the supernatural.
A spooky story! Very creepy with those stalkers. I guess that there's things you just can't run away from...
A book about the "lost generation" in every aspect. The theme of (giving up on) escaping fate can make this a sad read, but the title reminds us to keep up hope. And where other writers use beautiful words and mystery to captivate the reader, Hemingway applied way more subtle methods to transform this "story about nothing" to a modern page-turner.
Murder mystery. And then we start at the beginning, getting to know our protagonist and slowly finding out how she ended up like this. This book covers a lot of themes like apartheid, being an oppressed woman and the obstacles of changing yourself under societal pressure, so good luck analyzing!
Good book, though tiny. The composition & exuberant writing style fit with the surrealistic theme and leave room to compare many elements of the story with our reality.
A very entertaining, very bloody story >:)There aren't very much layers to analyse, but that gives an opportunity to really dig into the ones we do have.
Gehl manages to make the complex relations between people and urban space seem so obvious that you, the reader, immediately want to go into action and change things for the better. It is presented in such an obvious way that makes me clueless as to why cities are still built in ways that disregard life between buildings, i.e., massive buildings with empty facades, lack of public space, hard borders between the buildings and the street (mostly designed for motorised vehicular transport rather than people). Still, Life Between Buildings is engaging and empowering in understanding planning for co-location and social interaction: a practice that is, even after 50 years when this book was written, still underutilised.
Surprisingly engaging considering it does exactly what it says on the tin. A lovely read during the peak of Swedish winter: also known as April
undoubtedly a momentous book considering its strong message and the effect it had on colonialism. However, it was sad to see how much of an incoherent mess of loose thoughts and unnecessary narrative this novel is. Would have been fantastic as a manifesto.
Ecology & socialism: what's not to love
I am big dumb dumb for this grown-up book, send help
I wanted this to be my bible, but it just turned out to be a rehash of 100s of articles I read for uni. Guess it could have been if I read this at 22Still: Proletärer i alla länder, förena er!
"You are not a freak. You are wanted. You are necessary. You are the only you there is. Don't be afraid to leave the castle. It's a greatbig world out there." I wish I read this when I was in high school. I really, really loved reading this book.
I just don't understand why everything in this book went so wrong. I love this series but at the same time I hate it
I love the tv series, but I didn't know Belly would be so annoying in the books lol. But I love that Lola Tung narrates the audiobook!
3,5 stars ⭐️I had a fun time reading this book! There were a few moments I got a bit distracted with the details and didn't get what the author was trying to do with the story, but over all I really liked it! I also learned a few things about Taiwan and the country's culture, which was fun!This is a story about finding out who you are and what you want from life, but it's also about just having fun and doing the things you love to do. I recommend reading this ✨️
"She lived because she loved, and she lived because she was loved, and what a lovely lifetime she gave us."This book!! I love everything about this book 🫶🫶🫶
5 stars aren't nearly enough.This book deserves all the stars in the world 🫶
3.5 stars ⭐️The world building was a bit hard to get through, but I still really really liked this!! Listening to the audiobook while reading definitely helped. The further I got into the story, the more I started to enjoy it and I must admit: I absolutely LOVE Alaric. I'm convinced the next book will be even better!
Emily Henry never disappoints 🫶
I read this in one day and I love every second of it 🫶
Don't mind me, just bawling my eyes out over here
This series has my heart. I'll never grow tired of the stories of all these people going back in time, visiting loved ones one more time, telling them everything they never did, and making peace with what they have left in life 🫶
"Wait for me, where the land meets the sea." Such a beautiful story 🫶
3.5 stars ⭐️I honestly just missed so many moments from the tv series. Still love it, tho
I literally got the chills reading the last few sentences. So so so magical! This book has my heart 🫶🫶🫶
4.5 stars ⭐️I loooooved this! Now I want to read The stolen heir too 🥹
3,5 stars ⭐️I cried at the end and it was beautiful, but I wasn't as invested in the story and the characters as I hoped I would. Often while I was reading, I was hoping I would finish this book soon. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it tho! I would recommend reading this book 🫶
I'm addicted to this story omg
"And so I try to be kind to everything I see, and in everything I see, I see him."This book wrecked me. Such a beautiful, but heartbreaking story. I know I will be thinking about the characters and their stories for many days to come. I'm so glad I read this.
If this book was at least 200 pages shorter I would've given it more stars. It put me in a reading slump
I loooove this book! Omg it's the best
Nice rating
I love this book so so so much!!!
3,5 ⭐️I loved the storyline, but it all happened a little too quickly. If this was a whole book instead of a novella, I would've enjoyed it more. Still a very fun story to read, tho! I love everything Ali Hazelwood writes 🤭
If anyone is going to narrate the end of the world, then let it be Jenny Offill.
Not my favourite. The world and the characters didn't capture me as much as those in her other books. It also took quite long for the story to pick up the pace. The final reveal was a bit too obvious and this book didn't have any of the jaw-dropping plottwists Morton's books usually have. If anything, this book made me realize just how much I liked the other two books I've read of her.
Okay I have thoughts so buckle up. I really struggled with the beginning of the book because every character kind of felt like different versions of John Green himself. The book itself also felt a bit too classic John Green: the teenagers all had quirky names, quirky hobbies and a tragic backstory and all the adults were "not like other adults". So it took me a while to get into it. But then, I got into it. As in, stayed up at night until my eyes fell shut and then picked it up again first thing in the morning until i read the last page -into it. And that too was because of classic John Green-ness: describing feelings with analogies so accurate that as a reader it makes you feel known, interesting observations about language (do you ever think about how we have very limited language to describe physical pain? no? because i do now), and splattering the text with literary quotes (Dickinson, Shakespeare), because if there's anything John Green is good at, it's reminding me that I love language and words. So much. But then, I also got out of it again. I'll leave this review free of spoilers but I felt a bit unsatisfied by the ending. Then again, anti-climatic endings are also kind of John Green's thing (lookin' at you, Paper Towns) and there is something to be said for that. Hmm, I don't know. Either way I went through the full spectrum of emotions while reading this book, from eye-rolling and cursing at it to curling up with a stuffed animal while reading because things got real-real, real fast. So there ya have it. Confused thoughts on a book i sorta-liked-but-didn't-but-did.
I stayed up reading until 2am every single night, only to dive right back into it every single morning. I loved it. Thanks for the recommendation, Noa!
Phew. I feel like this really slowed down my goal to read 52 books this year, but I think this was also the first time I read a book of this length, so that feels like an accomplishment at least. I liked this one a lot more than The Secret History. Tartt is truly the master of painting a portrait of misery, but somehow the type of misery in this book suited me more than that in TSH. While reading, I joked sometimes that in all 800+ pages of this book, there were only about 50 pages that actually contained plot. Although it sometimes really did feel like that, I don't think that all the rest of the book was unnecessary or a waste of space. On the contrary, it made the whole story rich and textured and I did enjoy reading this book, a lot. The end held some true gems about the human condition and our constant struggle with quantifying things into morally wrong or right, and I am both sad and slightly relieved to leave these troubled characters behind.
Will write a review after part 3!!
I really liked it. I started running last year while writing my thesis, so for me writing and running have always been intertwined. This inspired me to pick up running again + to examine my own habits as a writer/translator. I also think I'm finally ready now to try one of his novels.
*4,5 I've always loved mythology, yet never read any kind of adaptations or re-imaginations, until now. I loved Circe from page 1, especially because she wasn't always likable. Whenever I picked up the book, I found myself wishing I could just stay in the world created by Madeline Miller. The story felt timeless, as if everything happened in the span of 3 weeks and 3 centuries at the same time. I most enjoyed the dialogue and interactions between characters, because for me that's where it really showed how well Miller knows and loves these characters. I also liked how 'aware' Circe seemed to be that she was in a myth. There were quite a few meta-references to how stories are told in hindsight and, more specifically, the often inaccurate portrayal of the role of women in those stories. I'm glad that so many of my friends/family have read this book too, because I want to talk about this for at least 4-5 business days.
Phew. This book was really cool but also deeply disturbing in a way I can't really articulate other than mentioning that everytime that I read it before going to sleep, I would have bad dreams and a fitful sleep. Every time. So despite liking it, and its message of the multitudes of people we all have inside of us, I also tried to finish it as fast as I could so that I could go back to my own much more boring and much more pleasant reality.
Really enjoyed this re-read because the first time I read this, I really sped through it because I so desperately wanted to know what would happen to all of them. I remember being really annoyed at all the 'side-plots' and new characters, because I just wanted to hurry along with the 'main cast'. This time around though, I really appreciated how Stiefvater kept on building the world, especially now that I've seen how she returns to that world in Call Down The Hawk. If anything, this book is an amazing set-up for the next trilogy, while also just being a beautiful final installment of the cycle. I also really felt how these books are cyclical, especially when you notice how much of the story is actually revealed in the first book, only to be contextualized in the final book because, as the books say, time is a circle! You can tell how much thought and care and plotting and patience Stiefvater put in these books. Definitely feeling the book-hangover after this one.
I thought this book was amazing. The first few sentences immediately struck me and made me want to read this book and I am glad that I did. The characters in this book are very relatable. Being kind of familiar with Green's and Levithan's other writings, it was easy to distinguish which Will Grayson belonged to which author. I loved how John Green (as always) created a character that was easy to love, relatable, kind, funny and the kind of friend you wish you had. Levithan's style is more harsh and cynical, just like his character. Levithan's Will Grayson made himself harder to love but very interesting. He was life-like, realistic, challenging and the kind of friend that grows on you over time. The story itself is crazy, with various plotlines, different angles and some amazing supporting characters. Throughout all the chaos and lovelines in the book, there are some beautiful passages and life lessons to be found in Will Grayson, Will Grayson, it's highly recommendable. With a boy/girl relationship, a guy/guy relationship and a lot of (unexpected) friendships, this book is open to any kind of friendship/love, which made it even more awesome, in my opinion. Well, those are some of my thoughts on this book. This is my first review so I hope I haven't made some horrid review mistakes (; Happy readings.
Quietly heartbreaking but empowering at the same time.
HAHA gawd I hope there's a written review coming
If I could give this more stars, I would. This was definitely the most fun I've had reading a book this year. At first, I thought it was a bit of a mix of Mistborn, Ender's Game and The Hunger Games, but now that I've finished it, it really is just its own story. It's Skyward. And it's awesome. In a book that's more than 500 pages long, it's kind of impressive that there's zero lulls or parts that I felt were unnecessary. Sanderson is not afraid to take his time, and it pays off beautifully. The character growth of Spensa, the main character, was so natural and subtle, that it wasn't until the final 100 pages that I realized that the girl at the beginning of the book had very little resemblance to the girl we got to know (and love!!!). I loved the mix of action (spaceship fights and lightlances!), intrigue (secrets and governments with unclear intentions!), banter (a rag-tag crew of aspiring pilots in flight school + a witty AI who's surprisingly emotional!), emotion (what does it mean to be brave!) and, strangely enough, physics...? As always, Sanderson's worldbuilding is not only amazing, but amazingly sound. Part of what made all the fight-scenes so engaging, was that the planes used very easy-to-follow laws of physics to manoeuvre (shoot-harpoon-at-debris-and-use-momentum-for-epic-swings type of physics), which was somehow so much more satisfying than any point-and-shoot could ever be. Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!
I remember devouring these books when i was 15/16 and buying the pockets in the 3 for 2 deals at Waterstones whenever I was in the UK. This summer I re-read the whole series again (one book per night, thanks to the heatwave making it impossible to sleep anyway) and I was hooked all over again. Some of the plot points in the series finale were already planted in the first book and there was a lot of foreshadowing throughout the series that I missed when I was younger. I also still love how almost every chapter ends with a cliffhanger, even if it is a bit cheesy. I just like this series a lot and it is extremely good at doing what it does. (I have a rant about how people tend to underestimate the writing skills it takes to write this type of "easy" action fiction, but i'm going to leave that for another time.)
Reading Winner feels like talking to a friend. An inspiring and intimate read.
Arundhati Roy writes with the kind of urgency that makes me feel like she writes simply because she needs to. As if there are a million stories trapped inside of her and all she has to do is let them flow out. The story itself was raw and beautiful and with a sense of impending doom that really grabbed me by the throat. Great read.
Beautifully written, brilliantly plotted and one of the most satisfying murder-mysteries i have read in a loooong time. I can't write much about it without spoiling anything but it does that thing where every chapter is from a different POV and they all have distinct voices and it's just. So. Good.(i might write a longer review later when ive had some time to articulate my thoughts re: the handling of power dynamics in this book because it was done in an incredibly refreshing way and i have thoughts.)
2013: Absolutely loved it. Perfect mixture of crime, con-tricks and magic. The air of mystery and plot-twists keep you on your toes and make you want to read more. Furthermore, Cassel is a great name ;)2019 update: I still loved it. I never really noticed how much the plotlines of the other two books get established and foreshadowed in the first book, which is really cool. Also, I still think Cassel is a great name.
Managed to finish this right before the new year. I didn't like this as much as everyone around me did. I felt heavy everytime I picked it up to read, so I'm kind of happy I'm done with it. Having said that, I did like the storytelling and the way the several timelines came together at the end.
LONG REVIEW BUCKLE UP. This honestly could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars but based on my personal reading experience I opted for the lower one. Reading this felt laborious because nothing really happened but nothing also happened very vividly. This resulted in me feeling bored out of my mind while reading it but at the same time I couldn't put it down. I think that if you like slow, descriptive books with passive characters that observe the world without really partaking in it, this book is a gem. Especially towards the end I started to feel like maybe I had been reading this book all wrong and I should've read it as an homage to the lengthy, 'eventful-in-their-uneventfulness', Russian novels like the one the title alludes to, but that revelation unfortunately came about 410 pages too late.It is very well-written, sharp as a tack and it's a lovely time-capsule of the college experience in the '90s, thanks to the attention to detail. On the other hand, if you don't want to find yourself shouting at the main character because you wish she would just DO, SAY or even THINK something, this may not be the book for you.
This is my favourite book I've read this year. I can't believe that this was Egan's debut novel because it's already so masterfully written. Her book 'a visit from the goon squad' has been one of my favourite books for years, but this one might even surpass it. It was delicate but sharp. Emotional and introspective but with a whirlwind plotline that kept me on my toes. I felt so much while I was reading this and when I finished the last page, I had to sit and stare and live in the feeling for a little while before I could get back to my life. Very deeply heartfeltly recommend this one!!
Incredibly captivating. Throughout the book there is this threat, creeping under your skin. I have had moments where I actually started looking over my shoulder or around me because I felt as if somebody was watching me. The way the story is told from an observer's perspective makes it less scary at first, but once the observer gets caught up in it herself, the mood gets even more frightning. The kind of book, so gripping that you want to yell at it and throw it across the room, but also the kind you want to hide in your closet after you read it... and not take it out for a while.
Another 5-star review for a book by Egan, although for entirely different reasons than the last one. It was clear that Egan had done intensive research into the Naval Yard, the NY underground, and the time period in general, which made for a stunning historical backdrop. This book felt... grand, in a way. I liked that the stories were told somewhat out of order and from different perspectives. There were a few twists and turns that had me flipping back a few pages to see the build-up, now that I knew what was actually going on. I have more thoughts but I can't be bothered to put up a spoiler-thingy or to really type it all out, so if you read it and want to talk, plz hit me up. As always, with Egan, the writing was just So.Good. Greatest novelist alive? Perhaps. Stay tuned while I read the rest of her oeuvre.
It was a lot of fun to re-read this, knowing everything that happens in the rest of the cycle. There were a lot of little hints and clues to big plot points in the other 3 books, that I hadn't noticed before. Also this is still one of my favourite urban fantasy series, ever.
Wow. What a gripping read. The language is inventive in a way I haven't really seen since reading 1984, with words like 'Econowives' and 'Particicution'. I like that she (both Atwood and the narrator) would constantly remind the reader that the story was only a 'reconstruction', sometimes recounting the same scene in a couple of different ways. I think the horror of things often lie in the unsaid and the insinuated, so that worked really well. What moved me the most was that the narrator had agency. Although the things that were happening to her were horrifying, she got to define what was happening to her. She talked about what she wanted to talk about and omitted what she felt was irrelevant or too painful. This stopped the book from being too voyeuristic or tragedy-porny. It felt, in a way, empowering to read about such a reflective main character. She seemed to have abandoned her body but kept protecting her mind. Other than that, I have a weak spot for books with truly evil women, because it shows that evil has no gender. It's all about power.
This one got pretty dark. I really liked that we got other character's perspectives in this book because I don't know if I could've handled another 400 pages of only the two angsty star-crossed lovers. I like that this book explored a more scientific take on the 'werewolf logic'. In the last book all we had was an 'it works because it works' situation, so the plot-twists (which i will not mention but they're neat + they put the title of the first book in a whole new light and i love that) added some depth to it all. However, I do feel like this book ended quite full-circle, so I wonder what the final book in the trilogy will even be about. Only one way to find out I guess..
Lovely, lovely prose. Can't wait to read more from this author.
Loved it! It's a classic prep-school elite club story which is right up my alley (gossip girl is still my go-to whenever i'm folding laundry or knitting) but with murder! intrigue! sleuthing! real believable characters! refreshing takes on old tropes! I like that the main character was so aware of the screwy power (and gender) dynamics within secret societies. There's a lot to unpack psychologically, without ever getting too heavy or preachy.Oh, and I also love that the main character was into astronomy because, well, same.✨
*4,5 God, this book. I only read four times. Four frantic times of inhaling the pages in some sort of trance. It's autobiographical to the point where it feels intrusive (but that also makes it so alluring). Filled with quotes by academics and artists, referenced in the margins (much easier on the eyes than footnotes bytheby) and surprisingly coherent for what seems to be a freight-train of thought and a waterfall-stream of consciousness. I need a nap. And to read this book again in a year.
Hi, don't mind me, I'm just quietly re-reading The Raven Cycle and constantly going 'huh, was this foreshadowed THAT EARLY?' all the time.
hello I've been re-reading my favourite teenage angsty heist and spy novels this summer and am horribly behind on my reading challenge so I'm gonna log them all in now xx
It was really cool to read one of Stiefvater's earlier books. It's much rougher and more YA-angsty than The Raven Cycle (which i love and which tbf has plenty of angst as well) but I kind of liked that. Everytime I opened it, I felt transported to the world of woods and wolves.
Big fan of the unreliable narrator and unlikable characters. I really liked the feverish, almost intoxicating atmosphere and the dialogue. The ending felt a bit unsatisfying but I also felt that it would've been hard to find a satisfying ending. Everything was set up as a fever dream, so any kind of resolve or logical action kind of breaks that sizzling tension. This has definitely made me want to read more of Levy's books in the future.
If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. Morton is such a skillful storyteller, leaving crumbs of information here and there so that you feel like you've got it all figured out, only to realise you've got it all wrong and you're exactly where she wants you to be and only know exactly what she wants you to know. Most of all, she writes women, so so well. I really liked her book 'The Secret Keeper', but I loved 'The Lake House'. Can't wait to read more of her.
If you are human, have ever been human or would like to be reminded that you're human, this book is for you.I love that this book is non-fiction, but written with all the structure and stylistics and story-telling of a novel. It was a beautiful read, very interesting and funny and heartbreaking and life affirming. It made me cry multiple times. But in the best way.
I didn't think I would cry, but I did. Hard. It was great. 10/10 would recommend.
This was a fun, sharp, quick read. I like the realism and the tension: it's one of those book where characters actually go to the bathroom, sweat and watch YouTube beauty-tutorials, but at the same time there is the droning hum of suspicion and threat. It was very satisfying, quick-paced, at times funny and at times suspenseful - like a good mini-series but in book form. I won't spoil the ending, but it felt like all the ties got wrapped up nicely and the book stayed true to its grim character, which I appreciated.
Yea, we're just going to 5-star this one. First of all, this is the first time in my life I've listened to an audiobook and I think this was the perfect one to start with. I listened to this while walking the dog every day and walking through the swedish forests with moss-covered rocks and trees all around was really the perfect backdrop for this book. I think CDTH is definitely a bit more mature than the Raven Cycle and I love that! I really feel like we, as an audience, get to grow along with these characters, true Harry Potter style.It seems like Stiefvater already knows exactly where all the arcs are going and I have no idea but I'm very excited. And the character dynamics are amazing, as always. My only real complaint is that the second book isn't out yet so I'll have to wait a while to see where this goes.
I picked this up, hoping for a not-too-terrible YA that would help me out of my reading funk. Instead, I was catapulted into a reading frenzy because my god, this book was good!!I am always a sucker for witchy magical realism in any shape or form, but this book went far beyond that. The characters had depth and originality. In the beginning you have no idea what the relationships between the characters are, or even who they are. I loved that it was clear from the start that not everything was revealed yet. You got just enough information to let your imagination run wild, but not enough for you to actually figure out what's going on, until the author wants you to. There's also a lot of representation and diversity in this book that came up very organically and never felt forced or like it was just there to tick a box. Topics like sexuality, race, disability and feminism were included or addressed without ever being at the foreground of the story or becoming the main part of people's identity. It just showed that we as people are diverse and honestly, it's quite nice when our media actually reflects that. Then the magic. Phew. Starting out quite innocent, the book gets darker and darker until you get to the catch-your-breath-audibly-reveals and shivers-down-your-spine-sentences. I love books where magic actually has consequences. Where not everything gets fixed and not everyone gets saved.If I could forget one book this year, I would wish it was this one, just so I could read it for the first time again.
I already knew the plot from the movie (and the wikipedia page I read before watching the movie because I scare easily don't judge me) and I really wished I didn't because I can't imagine how much fun it must be to go through all the plottwists and turns for the first time.The book was impeccable. The style, the social commentary, the distinctive voices of all the different Nicks and Amys. I loved every second of reading this and it also added much more depth to the movie, which I will now go and watch again.
This one is probably the most angsty one in the trilogy. At least angsty enough for me to spend a good amount of time daydreaming about the book and mentally making playlists based on the characters and their emotions.. This re-read is a lot of fun.
One of those "stumbled upon this in a secondhand shop and now it's one of my favourite books" situations. I've realized that a lot of my favourite books play with format and this book is no different. Written as a kind of academic case study, it is filled with citations, references and the occasional "visual aid". The index is called "Required Reading" and all chapter titles were titles of other novels (Room of One's Own, Paradise Lost, Othello, Wutherhing Heights, etc.). This could've easily been extremely meta and referential, but I loved how seamlessly all these elements were woven into the story, completely idiosyncratic to the main character and never too on the nose or gimmicky. The story itself is a wild ride, but the kind of ride that seems like a nice trip along the river and then only really gets wild in the last 100 pages and then you realize there's been alligators in the water all along and then you see a giant waterfall approaching in the near distance. That kind of wild ride. I think at some points my stomach actually, physically dropped and I think that if I read it again, I'll see even more hints and clues sprinkled throughout the first 400 pages. What really got me about this book was how deeply human it was. The protagonist is smart and well-read and extremely referential, but also intuitive, spontaneous, emotional and sometimes just plain teenager-dumb. This made her so real that towards the end of the book I started wondering if I really was reading an eyewitness account of someone who actually lived through all these events, despite the events being almost too crazy to be true. Now I can't say anything more without spoiling anything but I really liked this book and I'm looking forward to reading it again and again. (Also, hit me up if you want a rant about how this book is often compared to The Secret History by Donna Tartt because i have ~opinions~ about that.)
Moving, at times graphic, but always so wonderfully tender and I have to admit, I choked up when I read the last line. I love authors that manage to describe feelings that I always thought were indescribable, in a way that is so effortless and makes you, as a reader, feel known.
This was.. interesting. I didn't care much for the beginning but I did feel like the story got better and better as it unraveled. At times it felt extremely poignant and at others quite rough and unpolished. I might want to read this again at another point when I have more time and headspace to really think on it.
Very traditional 'Romeo&Julia'- story-line about forbidden love. However, the characters are interesting and it's well-written. It has been a while since I have read it but I distinctively remember being very caught up in the story, predictable as it was.
I think if I read this 3 years ago, I would've despised it and I think that in 3 years time I won't be this impressed but I've been reading a string of gender-themed, intense books, often playing with/bordering on the perverse, so this book came at exactly the right time. It reminded me a bit of The Circle (Eggers) and The Power (Alderman) but I liked this more than either of them. It's graphic, weird and almost comically out-of-control but the delivery is continuously sharp, clever and to-the-point. I couldn't predict any of the plot developments and I was thorougly entertained the whole way through.
Goed plot.
I liked the stories, but it feels a bit out of place compared to the other books of this series. It seemed to be a book that would give a backstory of Cardan, but it's also partially during and after the three novels. Like I said, the stories itself are okay, but it doesn't add much in my opinion. If I knew this from the start I doubt if I would have bought and read this book. Anyway, if you can't get enough of the characters after the three main books, I do still suggest you read this one. Even if it's just to be in this world a little longer!
Unfortunetely I DNFed this book. I just couldn't connect to the characters and I was over halfway trough the book and I couldn't care less about all the characters. If one had died I wouldn't be suprised and I wouldn't even notice the difference because they didn't mean anything to me. The plot sounds fun, and reading the book it was okay, so that gets 2.5 stars, and the book overal I would give 2 stars I guess, but I mark my DNF's as 1 star reads, so thats it for me. I know a lot of people liked it a lot, so if you read my revieuw, don't let it scare you away from the book! I'm sure most of you will like it! It's just not for me!
I love it! Especialy as a high intelligent person, this is everything I want! I'm always wondering 'what if' and this book answers these questions seriously but in a really fun way! Best way to spend your weekend😊
Wow, didn't saw this comming!! I really like this! I like the way it's writtenn that the youngest brother is the smartest and that it's so different form all the other books i've read! It's an original story that's well written. The thing why i don't give 5 stars is because it's a little easy written and i think the action is just at one point in the book. I had a few misunderstandings and the action started 'out of nowhere' a lot happened and then the book was finnished. So it was not the best book for me, but all the other aspects were very good. So i will definitely read the second book!!
Re-read this beauty for about the hundred time again, and it keeps getting better every time! No words left to describe the book as I'm craving for an instant re-read of this re-read!!!!!
A good book. Not fantastic and a little 'normal', but still a good one!
Finally finished the book! If took me ages to be able to read the last part, knowing what would happen after reading the first 6 books comming after this one. When I'm recovered from reading this and have prepared myself enough, I think I'm finnaly able to start reading the last book, Kingdom of Ash! I'm never emotionally ready for any of SJM's books, but I enjoy them so much I can't stop reading! So on to the next one(s)😁
Good book!! It's perfect! There's only the one last magic touch that is missing for me in this book. The one thing 'a court of thorns and roses' does have better.
It was such a nice book to read! I loved the magic system and found it nice to read a book that's not like all others. This magic system, the books, the demons, the libraries, everything fitted together exactly how it should. The only 'downside' for me was that the first half felt a bit slowpaced, while everything happened at once in the second half, which made it seem a bit rushed. The story itself though!! Highly recommend reading this one🤗
It is a well written book, but I don't like it as much as I thought I would. HSP is very well explained in here, but not in the way I hoped it would. It's just some examples with some little (not based on facts) theories that just didn't help me get more information about HSP. I hoped I would learn something from this book, but unfortunately I didn't. So it's a 2 star for me
I don't really see the connections between all the things that happen..... because of that, i don't really like it...
** spoiler alert ** In the beginning i didn't want to keep reading because i was in a reading dip, but when i picked it up again yesterday, i've read the rest all at once! It's an amazing book and i really recommend it! Like, i've just finnished it 30 minutes ago and in about an hour i'll have book 2 at home, and not a minute later😉 I can't live without knowing how my lovelies are doing!!!
I DNFed this book. I really like SJM's writing style and I've read almost all of her books, but this was not for me. I found I'm not a big fan of superhero stories and that this book isn't the genre I like to read. So it's not for me, but the writing style and the characters seem to be good, so I would for sure recommend reading it if you like this genre!!
A fantastic book!! But the ending..... i NEED to read tower of dawn as soon as possible!!
I love this book!! All the things in it are perfect!
It's just amazing. It provides you from background information and a sneak peak inside the life of wild horses. It's also full of information about how the best natural way of living can be created in our human world. I just love it, and even though I already knew some of it, it was very interesting and I learned a LOT!
I really liked the book! It's just another Sarah J Maas book, that means it's fantastic!! The only thing of this book is that there happened a lot and for me there was a bit too little information about all the specific things. But the rest is all amazing! Can't wait to read the next books!!
Just LOVE this one😍
Ehm, yeah..... the first trilogy in this series was fun, but i can't get into this one. I hoped to get motivated and read it completely, but it's a DNF for me. I wanted to give this book 2 stars, but as i mark my DNF as one star reads, i'll give it one star.
Just a perfect book!! Can't wait to read the next few books!!
Just a fantastic book with a huge cliffhanger! I can't wait to start 'heir of fire' in a couple of days (i have to wait till that book is back at the library)! My love for Sarah j Maas books was already sky high, but it keeps growing♡
A fantastic book!! I love it!
It's perfect! I don't know why i waited so long to start this book!It's just impossible to describe it good enough for this book.So i'll just say, read it yourself and you will see how great it is!!
It's just so good!! It's everything I would want in these kind of books. Brigid Kemmerer knows how to write her books so you will relate to them in a way that connects you with the story even more. Can't wait to start reading the sequel!
It's defenately better than the 3 books before, and i really like it!! All the little hints and things make sense now and in this book the big moment happend where the books before started to lead you to. Very well written and i would recommend this book!
Just a fantastic book! It describes the problems good and it's really helpful when you are struggling with a depression or something like that!
My second Jules Verne story after Around The World In Eighty Days, and while it included many of the same adventurous and fantastical elements I was hoping to find, it wasn't as exciting. A lot of the events in the book feel a little cliché and not well rounded enough. Most of the issues they faced were solved almost instantly. The one part of their journey that actually seemed to form a threat was also the most exciting part so I would have liked to see more of that. Nonetheless, a pretty fun read altogether. I also feel the need to mention that I was quite shocked at how racist the book was. It's clear that this book is a product of its time, which was a time in which it was still acceptable to refer to African people as if they were animals. It made me realise more than I already did that a lot of today's patronising attitudes towards the African continent still stem from colonial thoughts that were incredibly popular in the nineteenth century in Europe.
This is the first (auto)biography I've read, and while I'm pretty sure now that I prefer books with a clear plot, I still really enjoyed this work. Angelou has a lovely writing style that made it really easy for me to just keep reading because of the flow. I thought it was super interesting and gripping to read about how a black girl experienced American society during the time she grew up in. By switching between telling about the nostalgic and fun times of her childhood and then talking about horrible racist experiences she and her family endured she really showed how black people were (and probably still are) never really safe from marginalisation, and it really had an effect on me.
The book felt sort of like a political essay covered up as a novel, and I think it was interesting to read it in this manner. Really intriguing from the first page and quite haunting to think of having to live in a society like the one described. However, the characters were quite bland and for some reason, I just did not really connect with the setting that Orwell created. This could be my own fault for expecting more of an exciting novel than a critique/essay.
Fun and interesting book with a build up that made me excited (even though some chapters felt like they were just repeating themself). In the end, I don't think the build up paid off though...
I picked up this book because I absolutely loved The Secret History and I thought I'd definitely enjoy another novel by Tartt. However, I think this book is too slow and filled with information that I really don't care about as a reader. Furthermore, I do believe that if you start off a story with a particular event that seems like it should be solved, it's a bit of a turn-off when this event only plays a background role throughout. On the upside, I did enjoy the writing style and the different characters, and I actually quite loved the final one hundred pages, but that doesn't really make up for how much of a slog this story was to get through.
A really good book that read away easily. The story was quite heart-wrenching, but a sliver of hope remained during all parts of the story which kept me wondering what the characters' faiths would end up being. I liked how the story also gave a (very superficial) history of modern Afghanistan because it allows readers like me who do not know a lot about the country to understand the story to a fuller extent and to learn something new as well. I think this novel really showed how women are almost always the first to notice when a country changes for the worse in situations of conflict. My only issue with this book is that it is slightly noticeable that it is written from a western (specifically American) perspective, especially in the end when the characters believe that American presence in Afghanistan will provide a chance for a rebirth of Afghanistan after decades of worsening situations in the country.
This was such a fun read! It honestly felt like a major rip-off of the Secret History, but that's what made me like it. I really wanted to read about pretentious students and a murder case again, and this book completely filled that void for me. I do still think the Secret History is better and perhaps a bit more intriguing, but If We Were Villains is definitely up there as one of my favourite not-too-literary page-turners.
Really pretty book that shows longing and desire in a very effective and pretty way. Definitely preferred the second half, I thought the first half was perhaps a bit too slow. Overall definitely made me feel something!
A really fun book that read away easily. I kept wanting to continue reading even though it was never really clear to me where the story would end up going in the end. Perhaps the exciting moments could have been even more exciting, but overall I really enjoyed this.
Finally I'm freeeeee! While I think the main premise of this book is a great idea and the constant interjections of Indian history were interesting, I think it took way too long to get to the fascinating part of the story and those historical interjections often felt forced or randomly mentioned. I was also not that impressed by the writing style, and reading this book became a chore pretty early on.
My god, I was so bored reading this. There isn't really a clear story and whatever does happen just does not interest me. The book mostly consists of describing the regular activities of children in primary school, which I experienced about ten years ago myself, except I experienced more exciting things. A major slew to get through, and eventually, I read like one chapter every few days because it bored me so much, but I wanted to finish it as it's a pretty short book.
At the start of this book, I was unsure of whether I would like it. However, the fun and easy writing style made me want to continue reading and I started to become really interested in what was going to happen next in the story. Something about the setting and the characters and how they are described is very appealing to me, and even though there isn't a real plot, I still became invested in getting to know more about these characters and what their interactions with each other would lead to. Campert somehow managed to write about beating up an innocent old man, and a marriage that isn't working for either party involved in a very enjoyable and fun way, which takes some talent I suppose. I'm not entirely sure if I "got" the entire message of this book, and I'm a little confused about what the ending means, but somehow this doesn't bother me and I'm happy to keep dwelling on it. All in all, quite Vurrukkulluk!
A lovely little novella with simple writing that managed to bring across quite an array of emotions and character progressions in a small amount of words. Perhaps the simplicity of the writing kept me from being more blown away than I am, but I am still very impressed by Claire Keegan's ability to make me empathise so much with a character in such a short book.
A very intriguing and mysterious novel that kept me captivated until the end. I thought the atmosphere described in the book was so enjoyable, it was really easy to imagine what the House looked like and the author really managed to bring across what living in this place felt like. I thought the main character was charming and whimsical which made it fun to keep reading from his perspective, even when there weren't many actual events. The main mystery of the story kept me wanting to know more and I thought the revelations all made sense. I am very close to giving this book five stars because it was such a joy to read, but what is holding me back from doing so is that I think certain parts of the book could have been developed a little further, especially toward the end. I wanted more information for a better understanding of the House and the characters we see described in the journals, so I think I would have liked about fifty pages more of this book.
A very short book, but still manages to tell a good and captivating story. Obviously, in such a limited amount of pages it is hard for characters to become fully fleshed out, but I think Krabbé was able to inject enough personality into them to sort of understand their characters. Besides this, I think the descriptions of the scenery were really effective, I was completely able to visualise all events. It's a really thrilling book that builds up quite a bit of suspension and I really enjoyed how almost all details mentioned somehow play a role in the story. Great for if you want something quick and exciting to read. Would've been nice to have the female characters as more than just props for the actions of the men in this story though.
A pretty quick and easy read that I did not dislike at all. I thought the general theme of finding your spot in society and experiencing a change in "social rank" was interesting and I get why the characters did not have the most unique and extravagant personality traits (the book is called "Normal People" so that's not too surprising) to make it more relatable and realistic. However, for me, this also made the characters a little bland and I was not too emotionally invested in their character development, which seemed minimal to me. Overall, there were some moments that I really enjoyed reading, such as the part set in Italy, and the style of writing grew on me, but this novel did not really impact me in any way.
Before I started this book, I read some of the reviews on here and I thought I wouldn't be the biggest fan. The prospect of having an author preach the superiority of religion over atheism (or agnosticism really) was not something I looked forward to. However, to me, it was pretty clear that these thoughts came from the character Pi, and they do represent a mindset that is present within a large part of the world population, so I really didn't mind it that much. Besides, I think in the case of this book you can replace belief in a god with a belief that life becomes more beautiful if you accept stories and fantasies as valuable additions to life. Now, onto the rest of the book. I really loved the prose, it read away really easily. I also think it's quite impressive that Martel managed to write so many pages about such an isolated setting with almost no dialogue while keeping it interesting the entire time. The way he described everything that happened on the boat was magical, depressing, and yearnful at the appropriate moments, and it really allowed me to imagine Pi's experiences. Overall, just a very interesting mix of a great story with a sort of philosophical background that was entertaining throughout.
What a lovely story! A great mix of "coming-of-age" (in a 19th-century way) and romance in my opinion. I really love how Brönte was able to make so clear the effects that Jane's environments had on her, but also how her own authentic characteristics always shone through in her actions. Jane always clearly chose her own destiny and did what she felt was right, which I really enjoyed considering I sort of expected a 19th-century woman like her to just go along with the regular conventions of life in that time and show obedience to a man (like St John). Very glad this was not the case! Finally, I think Brönte was great at describing the surroundings, I was easily able to imagine what everything looked like in my mind. Would definitely recommend this book!
Fun and exciting, even when you already know the major reveal of the book! I thought the structure of the book was interesting with the final chapters being two letters from different perspectives detailing everything we did not see from Utterson's point of view.
Pretty interesting to read about growing up from a very different experience than mine, but I don't think this vignette style is for me. It kind of prevents a clear story from forming, which is what I prefer in a book. Although I must say that because each vignette was very short, it was useful for improving my Spanish, as I wasn't scared off by long chapters.
Such a perfect little novella to start the year off with! Keegan perfectly manages to create an atmosphere that brings across the warmth and also the coldness of Christmas. It is very impressive how, in a book of this length, the main character feels so round and manages to grow as a person. There is quite a wide array of themes that play a role in this story and they all work together marvelously and make you think about compassion while also educating you on yet another case of malpractices by the Catholic Church. I love how this story almost has a typical Hallmark feeling to it, but what is left unwritten and up to the reader pushes this novel into a more literary field in my opinion.
Really pretty and captivating short story.
A very pretty book with a romantic and captivating story. Interesting settings and I liked the inclusion of the political atmosphere in Iran because I learned something new reading this book, even though that was not the book's primary focus. Nothing too revolutionary when it comes to the plot or the writing, but just a very entertaining, easy and solid read.
I'm having a hard time deciding whether to give this book four or five stars. It is incredibly impressive that Mulisch was able to include so many different sources of inspiration from so many different schools of thought in a novel that still contains an understandable storyline. I can see why the inclusion of all of these themes can come off as Mulisch showing off, but I thought it was very interesting to read how Mulisch was able to connect religion, philosophy, politics, physics, etc. with each other in a logical manner, and I think it has shown me a new way of thinking about the world. Furthermore, I really liked the characters in the book and their relations with each other, and how these relations changed and functioned to further the story, it seemed pretty realistic to me. I think one of the only downsides of this book to me is that the final part of the book feels disconnected from the first part when it comes to the difference in tempo, and the intensity of supernatural occurrences. All in all, an interesting, but long read that I think I might return to when I'm a lot older, just so I may understand more of the symbols and references.

Really fun and easy read that reminded me of The Devil Wears Prada. Interesting characters and loved the general vibe.
Good book! Poetic prose and captivating stories.
It is quite unsettling how a book written during the interwar period describes the atmosphere in Western Europe today so eerily well. The ominous news items on foreign dictators, war, explosions and angry extremist groups strike fear into the hearts of most of us, but just like in the book this fear tends to be overshadowed by our everyday worries such as doing well in college or getting and keeping a job to pay off our college debts.I will not go too deep into George Bowling's character or the simple, yet amazingly executed plot. Other reviewers have done a better job doing just that than I could. It's George Bowling's thoughts and musings that I was so impressed by, especially his thoughts on peace. Society had been a lot tougher before World War 1, he noted. It was very common for people to die relatively young and poverty was far more prominent than after the war. Life was actually quite rotten, really, but hardly anyone ever worried about death, even though some terminal diseases can be just as painful a way to die as a bomb or a bullet. The quality of life might have not been that good, but everything seemed better to George because back in the day, fear was a rarer emotion. Everything went as it was supposed to go, whether that was favourable for you as an individual or not and nothing had seemed to change for decades. Ruthless dictators and advanced weaponry were simply unheard of.Am I jealous of those who have lived in the era before the World Wars? Not quite, but despite lacking good education, healthcare and material wealth, those people had a great luxury only children have today. Relative carelessness. Life has gifted me in many ways, but everything I think and do is lined by anguish of war and destruction. George is more afraid of the after-war, though. I cannot say I feel the same, because Western Europe and the USA have recovered quite well after World War 2. One could even say the war gave their economics the boost they so sorely needed. What I like about this detail, though, is that 1984 kind of is the world as George envisions it to be after World War 2, as I've read somewhere. I am looking forward to reading 1984, which might be Orwell's most proclaimed next to Animal Farm.
To me, this book was never about Afghanistan, nor was it meant to be educational. I felt like this was a story about a man who's past haunts him, and who just happened to come from a war-torn country.The reason I liked this book so much, was Amir. He wasn't a very likeable person growing up, in fact, he was a self centred little brat whose only real problems, before the war started, were his daddy issues. He treated his best friend like trash, because he knew that if only Hassan hadn't been a Hazara, everyone including his Baba would've loved the green-eyed boy a lot more. Not only was Hassan better at practically every sport and game, he also was a much better person who needed far less to be happy and content. If anything, the beginning of The Kite Runner is a tale of jealousy, an emotion I've been all too familiar with during my own childhood.Amir misuses Hassan's loyalty, because it's an easy way to get back at him for reasons the other boy can't even understand. He CAN push Hassan around like that, because he is a servant from an ''inferior'' race.Amir grows up and lives to regret his past, however. He doesn't want to save Sohrab, Hassan's son, just to be a good human being and bring love and joy and happiness into this world. He seeks atonement, penance. ''A way to be good again.'' Ironically, he messes up again during his journey, right when things are looking up for both the boy and him. The way he messes up is funny because it nicely illustrated how Amir changed as a character; he used to be this spoiled, overly prudent little boy with a mean streak, but becomes reckless, passionate man who leaves little room for contemplation a few decades later. The reckless, passionate man who leaves little room for contemplation refuses to give up on Sohrab and thereby, give up on himself, though. Which I find to be a good message. Everyone does bad, sometimes even evil things they later regret, sure. Anyone can become victim of another one's malevolence, or a simply rotten situation, as well. But all we really can do is go on, and try to do what seems best right at the moment we're doing it.(Ha ha, sorry if this was a bit of a messy read, I just wanted to jot down my thoughts on this book quickly. I tried to spoil as little as possible!)
This is a great book if you want to gain more insight into the sources of Carlos Castaneda's thinking and his personality. The title and printing looks a bit cheap, but the book is quite intellectual and intelligently written, with a lot of philosophical and academic references. Margaret Runyan tells in some detail about her life with Casteneda, mainly from 1955 to 1960. It's quite a revelation for me that the mysticism and drugs culture of the 60's actually started already at the end of the 50's. In that way Castaneda was not really ahead of his time, but rather on top of it, finding a new approach. There was hardly anything new about the things he wrote about peyote, datura and psilocybe, put he added a lot of detail and tied everything so nicely together that it worked like a charm. It's clear that Carlos Castaneda is the ultimate outsider, an identity that he amplified himself by freely traversing to and fro between fact and fiction, in his private life as well as in his work. He's the ultimate traveller lost between worlds: Peru, Brazil vs the USA, immigrant in his thirties amongst students in their twenties, academic life vs literature, being married vs unmarried, having a kid vs having no kid, being a psychedelic astronaut vs a straight suit & tie academic. The confusion of readers expecting a magical hippie guru vs the short, stocky Peruvian guy that he was. Magician vs sorcerer. Lier vs prophet. The most inspirational part is to read how in the middle of the '60 he seemed quite lost, having failed as an artist, flunked his studies, private life a mess, his investigations among Mexican indians stranded in inner turmoil. The college professor had already given up on him. And then in 1966 or 1967 he handed in his "thesis" on his professors desk, a book which became The Teachings of Don Juan, making him world famous eventually. Not a trustworthy but a remarkable man who must have felt the burden of being an outsider for most of his life, turning it to a strength. It seems that in his books he never really conquered or tamed the ally, that The Teachings of Don Juan was all about.
This booklet is a small gem, powerful in its simplicity. It inspired me to intensify my meditation practice and really make the effort of "lighting a fire" during meditation, instead of doing it half-heartedly. It's also somewhat humorous, because the disciple in the dialogue puts forth all kinds of objections he can think of to explain why he can't do what he is supposed to do. Webu Sayadaw explains how anapana meditation, which is usually seen as a concentration exercise, can be approached as a form of insight meditation.
The first book I read by Crowley. The Book of the Law is really more of a booklet, but in this edition some other texts and poems and a satanic mass were added. I'm not a satanist, I just bought the satanic altar edition because it's affordable. Well, this is quite a book. It's clear to me that Crowley really believed that the Book of the Law was dictated to him by Egyptian gods, and wrote it in a trance-like state. In 1904 he was already deeply versed in the occult, so I can see easily how this book could come up in écriture automatique. It's pretty powerful and mystical and clearly draws a lot from Buddhist thought. Three Egyptian Gods (which Crowley took from an ancient stèlè) address the reader in turn: Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Crowley identifies the female goddess of the heavens, Nuit, with the unformed "All", Matter or Being. Male Hadit is the universal Ego or Consciousness; he also becomes the axis of the wheel of karma when Hadit merges with Nuit (or Osiris with Isis). Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Hoor = Horus) is their son; he is both a war God and a silent, hidden force. Horus is also the Goat, because apparently his sunsign is Capricorn.In the intro, the editor shows that Crowley also identified Hadit with the Snake, the Devil or Satan. But Horus, being the goat, is also the Devil. And then there is Aiwaz, the spirit who dictates the book to Crowley, chanelling Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Crowley equals Aiwaz with Lucifer, Lucifer being the angelic version of Satan. So it's all a big jostle of gods, a satanic take on the Trinity of the Christian God; Devil the mother, Devil the Father, Devil the Son, Devil the Wholy Spirit, in the guise of the Egyptian pantheon.Anyway, the anti-christian moral teaching must have been rather refreshing and shocking in 1904. It's all about embracing your instincts and desires. Apart from all the talk of sex and drugs, Will and "love under will", there is unfortunately also a lot of talk of blood sacrifice, war, trampling enemies, and having no mercy. This is black metal avant la lettre, but with poetic words instead of rock music.Now, from a literary point of view this is an interesting book, full of magic, numerology and mystery. Crowley himself took seven years to decipher his own writings and explains most of the meanings in the comments. It's clear that he tries to smoothen down the murderous sounding paragraphs of the document. They're Aiwaz' words, not his words. Crowley draws heavily on Nietzsche and Buddhism and Schopenhauer, but he turns Will into the ultimate good, at the same time saying that the devotees should practice their will without attachment, which he takes from Buddhism... In Buddhism all identification with Will is considered exactly the cause of all suffering. But Crowley sings high praise of the idea of craving, of infinite desire. His advice to drop attachment is totally gratuitous, he offers no method. The Book of the Law does not give a solution for suffering; it just claims that by following the wizards way, you can live a life of extasy and infinite pleasure; it's just all the other people who suffer; the wizard should not pity them, but trample them - according to the words of Hadit. What also strikes me as very odd, is Crowleys insistence on sterility. Pan is sterile, the devil is sterile, etc. Why sing praise of sterility? What kind of fundamental hate of life is behind that? But this view echoes the Buddhist view on sex which is also very negative, because sex perpetuates karma. The ultimate goal of Buddhism, enlightenment for everyone, which stops rebirth and the wheel of karma, would actually mean the extinction of mankind in the material realm as well.But Buddhism point at lust as one of the three main causes of rebirth and suffering, while Crowley points at lust as a primary goal in life. The proof of the cake is in the eating. If we look at Crowleys life, it does not seem that his newfound religion and adoration of Ra-Hoor-Kuit brought him much good. He lost his first child after two years, which he explicitly interprets as a sacrifice demanded by Ra-Hoor-Khuit and which caused him much sadness and pain (he did not kill the child, it died of sickness in another country, possibly neglected by its alcoholic mother). Crowley's second child despised her father and desinherited him. His third child turned out a schizophrenic who believed himself to be the Lord Supreme of England. So there you have your sterility. Crowley himself got addicted to heroin, got rid of it, and fell back to heroin addiction. He went bankrupt when he was 60. His first wife became a hopeless alcoholic and lost her mind. Yes, he gained a lot of fame and notoriety and he had a lot of sex with younger women. Nevertheless his life is proof that his religious path demands a very high charge and it's pretty hard to see him as an enlightened person. It's really the classical "sell your soul" story. "I will give you infinite pleasures, but in three years time I will come and take your child." The man was very privileged, by the way. All the traveling and mountaineering in his youth was not his own achievement but was made possible by the money of his stern Christian parents. Crowley was extremely two-faced, in his being and in his writings. So it can all be seen as play: the talk of blood sacrifices, the talk of war and destroying enemies, the racism, the misogyny, the arrogance and lack of pity towards the poor and suffering, the adoration of "hell" and "evil". Why would one truly want to go to hell, if you believe in such a thing, unless you give a completely new meaning to hell? But Crowley does not. He makes hell a place of eternal sterility, war and blood sacrifice. Not much fun, I would say. Yet it's all great and wonderful, apparently.This book is the true foundation of Crowley's religion, which he really believed in, and it's all there. One can interpret the "blood of children" as semen, but words have power. That does not mean that I think Crowley was truly evil or committed any crimes. I think he was half a psychopath, but with a gentle nature. Although... in his younger days he was known for beating the sherpa's on his mountain expeditions. In his comments racism seeps through. He is also clearly anti-democratic, saying the equality is an illusion. Kings have every right to trample the beggars. A bit of a fascist he certainly is. He has good points too. Of course, the earth-gods and the gods of life and lust deserve much more respect than they got in Christianity, which denies the body, mother Earth, and material life in general. This book pushes back very hard against that. There's great imagery and mystery, great thrill and mysticism. The best mysticism is stolen from Buddhism. But to my taste it's too imbued with testosteron, desire of war, blood-thirst, male ego.I regret that the religion is not more like the included poems such as "The wizard way". They have great Tolkien-like imagery. Although it's said that Crowley sucked as a poet, I rather like them.
One of the most brilliant and unique books I ever read. It's the style and way of looking at the world of the other which is so enticing. There is surprise in almost every sentence. It's so unique in it's kind that it doesn't matter that there is actually no real dialogue, and that some of the plot seems to lack reality. All the characters tend to speak in monologues only. But it's so funny and the main character is so fascinating.
Very amusing book, especially the first 3 quarters. It's almost chicklit, but also very far from it. The supernatural and mystical aspects of the union with the godlike male antagonist, and the mythological aspects give the book that bit extra. The style can be very poetic at times, especially in the seascapes, but the sex scenes never are, unfortunately. In the last quarter, the book becomes a bit artificial and constructed and the female protagonist loses some credibility, especially in the dealings with the dog, but the finale is in style and matches well with how it starts. There is sex, but I wouldn't say the book is sexy. The sex scenes are crude but not quite as disgusting as some people say they are. I found them mostly amusing in their honest description of all the flukes and mishaps in sex. If the sex-scenes are ever a turn-on, it's not in a literary way, rather in a You Porn kind of way. But the book is hardly about sex, really, it's about addiction to the need to be desired, about escaping reality, and about being emotionally unhinged. I had a lot of fun reading it, with some irritation in the last quarter.
Character-driven stories with excellent decors. Very well written. The characters are mostly rather unsympathetic and antisocial to some degree. They have these moments where they just don't give a fuck about themselves or other people, and will do or say destructive things just for the hell of it. There is little love, beauty or divinity to be found, at least not in the people. Everyone is poor, lonely or tired of life. There is seldom a point or final outcome to a story: the characters are picked up and left alone again, somewhere along the road of their broken dreams. The title does not really cover the content in my opinion. There's a lot of "Tired of this world" and "Hating this world", but the other world never comes into view, there is no feelingof anything outside daily reality, apart from the hatred and sense of disconnection with this reality. The title comes from the last story, where a girl child is convinced she has to kill an arbitrary person to get back to the "other world". The book ends where the girl is going to kill the man or get killed by him.The author is good at summoning diverse characters. Nevertheless, sometimes the credibility of the characters crumbles, when she projects too many feminine behaviours and ways of thought on male characters, or when her character "dabbles" in heroin and meth, like they could be recreational drugs - but then shrinks away from yellowish crystals - which is what meth looks like. The writer is so talented that she becomes sloppy sometimes. Anyway, a great read, but i wouldn't be much inclined to read another book of the author, I find the storylines too random and depressing in the end. I'm missing any sense of metafysics.
Entertaining and skillfully written satire on Brexit. The idea of the reversed economy is quite ingenious. Recommended to Johnson-haters.
If you want to read a good book by Carlos Casteneda, I suggest you begin with the Teachings of Don Juan, his first; A separate reality, his second. Or Tales of Power, his fourth. But better start at nr 1 and work your way through. Castaneda changes his terminology and imagery with every book, drawing on new sources and adding new interpretations. An excellent analysis of his shapeshifting ideas and their partly native American origins can be found here: https://digilib.phil.muni.cz/bitstrea...This is the 6th book of Castaneda, following the "Second ring of Power". The doubling up of identities, sorcerers, characters and states of awareness is taken to a whole new level in this book, resulting in a flurry of badly defined characters and events. I found it pretty hard to read through. As a story, it's much worse written than "Tales of power", one of his best. So, what's it all about? It turns out that during the whole course of years of Don Juan's teachings that are described in book 1 to 4 (which are told to have taken place mostly in the '60s), that was only half of the time that Castaneda spent with Don Juan and his fellow wizards. That all took place in "right side awareness" or everyday awareness. But apparently, Don Juan would regularly tap Casteneda on the back and thereby shift Castaneda to "left side awareness" or "heightened awareness", of which he would have zero recollection later, never noticing the huge intervals of lost time. Only now, ten to twenty years later, he remembers all this. It turns out that during his time in "left side awareness" he received much more explicit and revealing teachings from Don Juan and many other warriors, already starting on his very first visit to Don Juans house in 1960. And only in this book, published in 1981, he suddenly remembers all this. So: during that time in "left side awareness" he got acquainted with a huge extended family of wizards or warriors, (1) a whole group of men and women formed around the Nagual Don Juan, (2) a new group of men and women formed around Castaneda who is chosen as the new Nagual, (these people are first introduced in book 5, "Second ring of power", but now it turns out he already knew them for ages, just forgot about it), and (3) a departed group of men and women formed around Don Juan's former teacher. The book makes the point that there is a succession of naguals, where in every new generation of nagual needs to form his own little cult of warriors. Why? Because it's the rule of the Eagle. The Eagle is now what all the warrior's work is about: a kind of Death God, apparently inspired by Moloch Baal or Kronos, who eats the souls (consciousness) of all people when they die. And apparently the purpose in life of warriors such as Don Juan is to invest years and years of their life to create a double of themselves, a full recollection of their life, to offer to the eagle, so that they may not be devoured by the Eagle themselves - and live forever in the afterlife. For this purpose, they must perform years and years of repetitive exercises: sitting in wooden crates trying to relive all their life up to that point, swinging from the ceiling suspended in leather straps ("non-doing"), staring at heaps of leaves for months on end ("gazing"), etc. For example, one character, Dona Soledad, is said to have spent 5 years sitting in a wooden create, remembering her life up to then, in order to secure a safe pass by the Eagle. Yes, five years in a wooden create, in order to be better off in the afterlife. That beats any conception of Christian martyrdom and in itself is more than enough to put me off from taking anything literal that Castañeda comes up with.I would say that this whole obsession with forming your own cult reflects perfectly what Juan Castaneda was doing in his real life, in the late '70s (almost 20 years after meeting Don Juan). Sounds almost like he developed an interest in SM, looking at all the locking up in cages and pointless swinging from leather contraptions from the ceiling for hours and hours, days and days, years and years. The swinging from leather contraptions is adequately called "not-doing", a notion vaguely copied from the Taoist concept of non-ado. And its purpose remains totally vague - in a later book Castaneda defines the purpose of "non-doing" as breaking through the conventional run of events, to shift the awareness and reveal life's intentions.There's nevertheless quite a bit of interesting new detail on the art of Dreaming (basically, getting control of your dreams to the point where you can perform actual miracles in daily life, like flying) and the art of Stalking (basically, getting control of people and events in daily life, manipulation and stealth techniques, to accomplish your goals in the magic world of the Eagle). If you still buy it.Oh, yeah: we are also supposed to believe now that all the knowledge of Castaneda comes from the Tolteks, who lived in Mexico from the 10th to 12th century A.D. It took him 6 books and 20 years since the beginning of his apprenticeship with Don Juan to "remember" that. Concluding, i.m.o. Casteneda takes the trickery to a whole new level in this book. It's a big question for me which parts of his practical teaching about Dreaming, Stalking, etc would really pay off any of the effort described. Some of it might. But there's just way too much discrepancy between the first books and the latter books. I see no foundation for credibility either in Casteneda's life or the accomplishments of his pupils. The characters, the theories, the practices, they keep changing with every new book. Castaneda makes it all up on the fly, picking up ideas and discarding them as best suits his literary and personal goals.
This cult book is often described as pseudoscientific amusement, a collection of weird facts, but it's much more than that: its core is deeply philosophical and deals with epistemology: the philosophy of knowledge (and, therefore science). In short, the author has collected over decades all published science that didn't fit in with scientific paradigm.The first chapter of this book is genius. It contains a blistering epistemological analysis of what knowledge is, and makes the philosophical point that in this world there exists no such thing as a "thing". There is nothing in the world that can be separated from all the rest that exists, and thus be considered as an individually existing thing. It's an insight that comes very close to the Buddhist insights of interbeing, no-self and and impermanence."What is a house?It is not possible to say what anything is, as positively distinguished from anything else, if there are no positive differences. A barn is a house, if one lives in it. If residence constitutes houseness, because style of architecture does not, then a bird's nest is a house: and human occupancy is not the standard to judge by, because we speak of dogs' houses; nor material, because we speak of snow houses of Eskimos—or a shell is a house to a hermit crab—or was to the mollusk that made it—or things seemingly so positively different as the White House at Washington and a shell on the seashore are seen to be continuous.So no one has ever been able to say what electricity is, for instance. It isn't anything, as positively distinguished from heat or magnetism or life. Metaphysicians and theologians and biologists have tried to define life. They have failed, because, in a positive sense, there is nothing to define: there is no phenomenon of life that is not, to some degree, manifest in chemism, magnetism, astronomic motions."That is not to say that Fort limits himself to conventional monism (the idea that all "things" that seem to have identity of their own are only islands that are projections from something underlying, and have no real outlines of their own). He also makes the striking point that "things", although they are only projections, are projections that are striving to break away from the underlying matrix that denies them identity of their own. So these projections construct an identity; and they do that by excluding other things. (I'm mostly using Fort's words here). This then also applies to living things or humans. "Anything that tries to establish itself as a real, or positive, or absolute system, government, organization, self, soul, entity, individuality, can so attempt only by drawing a line about itself, or about the inclusions that constitute itself, and damning or excluding, or breaking away from, all other "things""."Just as would one who draws a circle in the sea, including a few waves, saying that the other waves, with which the included are continuous, are positively different, and stakes his life upon maintaining that the admitted and the damned are positively different."This is a concise rational analysis of how the illusion of "self" leads to the negative effects of separation, of causes and effects, of karma, and is deeply Buddhist/Hindu in nature.From here, Fort goes on to attack the idea of objective science. He demonstrates that positivist science can only exist by faulty definitions and the exclusion of many unwanted data.Fort is the ultimate sceptic. He is sceptic of all attempts to model reality, and he is particularly sceptic of science: "All sciences begin with attempts to define. Nothing ever has been defined. Because there is nothing to define. Darwin wrote The Origin of Species. He was never able to tell what he meant by a "species.""After this, Fort goes on to trash Darwin a bit more, demonstrating the tautology in Darwins most famous aforism (which was not really coined by Darwin, but still used by him in later editions of his work):"The fittest survive. What is meant by the fittest? Not the strongest; not the cleverest —Weakness and stupidity everywhere survive. There is no way of determining fitness except in that a thing does survive. "Fitness," then, is only another name for "survival." Darwinism: That survivors survive."Fort doesn't have a special thing for Darwin. He attacks all fields of science. Charles Fort spent the rest of his life searching for all the scientific data, published in scientific publications, that didn't fit in with the accepted theories. The "damned" data. And then he put all these damned data neatly together, and made up new exotic theories to accommodate them - knowing very well that they were mostly absurde. Hence the name of the book. As far as I'm concerned, the first chapter is the most interesting part, because it offers the philosophical foundation for everything Fort has written and done the rest of his life. Most of the rest of his writing is about the amazing and crazy facts he found over decades of research. Many of them are about things that fell from the sky: rains of frogs, rains of red jelly, rains of blood, rains of fish, etc. Many of these things have been explained by science later, or are still waiting to be explained. But the fundamental point of Fort, which drives all his writing and efforts, is the insight that any effort to model reality and fit it in scientific theories, is always a violation of reality. It can only function by excluding, killing off, ignoring other parts of reality. In the Wikipedia descriptions of Fort's work, there is too much stress on the exotic quality of his findings and writings, and he is described as a kind of science fiction writer. But the fundamental motivation for his search is deeply philosophical. He makes the point that all that exists strives to manifest itself as an entity, attaining to the Universal; but it does so by cutting itself loose from the rest of creation. Or as Fort says: "Our whole "existence" is an attempt by the relative to be the absolute, or by the local to be the universal. Every attempt—that is observable—is defeated by Continuity, or by outside forces—or by the excluded that are continuous with the included."Chapter 1 is an incredibly concise description of the fundamental conflict of existence, which gives birth to the law of Karma, which gives birth to the despair of Existentialism. The Universal, as Fort describes it, also comes very close to Spinoza's definition of Substance or God.I haven't finished reading it, so I can't really give stars. But chapter 1 is 6 stars for me.
"She did not go away next morning; all that day she did not go, but helped about the place; milked the goats, and scoured pots and things with fine sand, and got them clean. She did not go away at all. Inger was her name. And Isak was his name."I've loved every book by Hamsun I read so far. Hamsun received the Nobel prize for this one, so it's presumably his best one, but personally I liked "Hunger" more. This is a great book though. It tells the story of how wild nature becomes inhabited by man, starting with absolute wasteland, ending in a more or less organised society. It's a story of creation, a Genesis. It start's with a lonely couple settling as farmers in remote Norwegian wilds, having nothing but hard work. From there things develop fast, but at a slow pace. The book is remarkably fresh for a book from 1917, and the characters are so vivid and deep. Hamsun is an all round author, great in style, great in characters, great in storylines, in the passage of time, in life, love and death. There's a lot of humor, tragedy, psychological depth, history. It portrays beautifully how early man (or in this case 19th century rural man) worked with nature, and the rise of modern technology in the wilds. The only downside to the novel is that perhaps it glorifies the idea of the strong, simple, self-sufficient farmer a bit too much; the central character Isak is wonderful, but eventually he becomes stagnant and is moved to the background of the story; other characters take over the story line. This is probably the reason the book has no clear climax or catastrophe; it just stops after a number of big changes and developments, when Isak gets old. But there is a host of fascinating characters, in the first place Isak's wife Inger and the intriguing freehweeling Geissler who are much more dynamic and drive the story. But also the old meddling Oline, the slacker Brede, the girl Barbro... all characters are 4D and are quite unforgettable. The English translation by W.W. Worster is outstanding, as far as I can judge.
An entertaining investigation into grief, loss, love, sex, transience and obsession which takes the phenomenon of colour as a metaphor for love and other psychological phenomena which live in between the material world and the mind. Many interesting quotes, well written. The focus on the colour blue ties it all together while it skips along the surface of many subjects, like impermanence, Buddhism, ecstasy, alcohol, God and "fucking". The author collects intellectual tidbits around her interests and obsessions, like she collects blue things. Together they form a beautiful collection to look at, but in the end it feels a bit superficial and unsatisfying to me. Like visiting the house of an OCD-person and seeing their collection of whatever obsesses them. Like watching a face with a lot of make-up.You can't really see what's underneath. I can't really identify with it. Therefore 3 1/2 stars for me, but because of the perfect execution I'll give it 4.
The book fundamentally changed my outlook on global human reality in a positive way, but it also has a major flaw. I will start with the positive and end with the negative. Anyone who thinks "everything is getting worse for humanity" and "the gap between the rich and poor will never be filled" should really read this book. It will make you more optimistic or, in the words of the author, "probabilistic" about the future of humanity, with some serious and exciting statistics. It demonstrates and proves how the innate dramatic instinct of people prevents us from seeing the global (human) reality as it is. One example: all gradual improvement in the world goes completely unnoticed because it is not news. But any setback receives extensive media coverage. That is not a mistake of the media, that is how our dramatic instincts work. We mainly pay attention to what goes wrong. And actually there is so much more that goes well, or at least is improving. This book lays bare the huge misconceptions you and I inevitably have and gives us tools to see the (human part of the) world more clearly in the future.Nevertheless the book looks at the world from a purely antropocentric perspective and is deliberately misleading. The Quiz it starts with contains one serious error which betrays a blind spot of the author. The answer to Key question nr 11 (about threatened species) that the author gives, is false. The right answer is that 1 of the 3 mentioned species has become more endangered, namely the tigers. But the author explicitly claims (on page 190 of the English pocket edition) that tigers have risen in number since 1998, along with panda's and rhino's. It's true for the panda's and rhino's, but it is very untrue for tigers. They have diminished by half. In Vietnam and Cambodia they have completely died out in the wild. This illustrates a broader point, namely how the author is deliberately oblivious to the downside of humanity's progress: the impact on our environment and ecosystems. The chapter on climate change is very weak and lacks any serious infographs such as the other chapters have in abundance. It feels like it was inserted at the last moment, in order not to ignore the subject of environment completely. The book does ignore all other environmental subjects; the scarce data on biodiversity that the book contains (the tiger/panda/rhino example) actually contradicts the cited IUCN sources. Therefore the book lost one star to me in first instance, thinking it was ignorance. Later I took 3 more stars away, when I realised it's deliberate. See PS.PS: I e-mailed the Gapminder association about the biodiversity error it a few times, but they don't respond and have not corrected the error, instead resorting to wordplay about category definitions. A bit like saying that a country where income has decreased by 50% has not become poorer because it's still in poverty category 2. That's deliberate cheating and it makes clear that what I thought was a "blind spot" has become intentional misinformation. I'm going back to 1 star. The book is so successful and influential that it should not be spreading a false message about biodiversity and the human-caused mass extinction of species, which, according to the Stockholm institute, is at the moment the most worrying transgression of planet boundaries, on a par with global warming. The book makes a very strong ethical claim. Turning a blind eye to the 6th mass extinction, even to the point of trying to cover it up, does not go along with that.
Entertaining and fascinating theories from the fringe of science. 35 crazy theories, most of which have proven wrong, but some that have proven right, and a lot that seem not entirely right, but do make quite a bit of sense. This book also illustrates how new theories and insights often appear insane or outrageous, until the evidence stacks up and suddenly everyone has to accept them as true, which eventually becomes "everybody knows that, duh!". It's great how this book delves up the theories that haven't quite made it yet, and explains in detail how the scientist came to his or her ideas and how they were refuted. The cover of the book looks a bit sensationalist, but the subjects are actually quite well researched. It also shows how the champions of science will often try to suppress new revolutionary insights and wreck their colleagues careers for it - but eventually, twenty or thirty years later, have to apologize. It was interesting to find that live on Mars was quite likely detected already in 1978, that the cult of Jezus was propelled by Roman emperor worship, and that there are good reasons to believe that Homer may have been a woman, and that it's quite imaginable that intelligent life has risen on planet Earth before - and destroyed itself so long ago that it's very possible we'll never find fossil records of it. The chapter "What if we live forever" is the weakest to my liking, it's actually about parallel universes, and the conclusion about living forever makes no sense when we only experience one universe at a time. That's the only place in the book where I really went "Oh come on, cut the bullshit".
I can imagine this book must have been quite a revelation in 1968. A practical introduction to shamanism through the use of psychedelic plants, with very detailed and fascinating trip reports of psilocybe mushrooms, peyote cactus (mescaline) and Jimson Weed (datura). The second half of the book is a bit dreary, a "structural analysis" of the events, because Castaneda originally wrote this book as a thesis. He makes the point that there is a consistency and predictability in "non-ordinary reality", which can be studied and learned and put to practical use. It is well known by now that the teachings of Don Juan have very little to do with actual Yaqui religion, which has been studies by others, but then again Castaneda allows for such inconsistencies by revealing that Don Juan had only 1 Yaqui parent and was also taught by a sorcerer who wasn't Yaqui. The book also mentions a daughter-in-law, meaning that Don Juan must have been married and had a son. I assume that Don Juan is semi-fictional, and was inspired by one or several shamans and teachers that Castaneda met over the course of his studies.The crazy details about handling the Jimson Weed and the statements of doubt by Castaneda himself make the book so appealing. Still it's quite unbelievable that Castaneda got a MSc and Phd with his books about Don Juan Matus. Anyway, an interesting read for anyone interested in alternate realities.
'Carlos berated me severely and repeated something he was telling all the apprentices - that he tried to lift my 'energy body' from below, banged his head on my damaged aura, and had to be driven to the UCLA emergency room by Muni. He insisted he had a concussion.I wept hysterically to Florinda. "I let down Carlos!"'One should judge people by their actions. If it isn't clear from reading his latter books that Carlos Castañeda was an abusive cult leader with a dictator's ego and a pathological lier ('stalker', Castañeda would say) with a great talent for telling stories, this book paints the most vivid picture of his personality I've read so far. But the idiocy of the author, who was 35 when she submitted herself to Carlos' little abusive cult, makes this book almost unbearable to read. It will be an eternal riddle to me why some people are so eager to completely submit themselves to people who try to annihilate and control them. Although Wallace describes knowing Castaneda as a rather crooked family friend from her 17th to her 34th, she later still turns out believing any moronic bullshit Carlos comes up with. The thrill and excitement of being around Castaneda seems to be the catch: he was famous, rich, completely unpredictable, sweet one moment, screaming the next, abandoning you at the slightest whim, making himself ever unavailable, rewarding you with short moments of intense attention, turning even the most mundane daily activities into magical events of life and death importance. (Feel that gust of wind? It's the nagual warning us! Quickly, jump on the table, close your eyes and eat this magical button! You will kill us both if you don't do it now! Noooo, don't look around at the window! You shouldn't have looked around! You have failed me! You have spoilt everything! You're worthless! Carajo! You're nothing! - and poofff, off he is, until he calls you from a new phone number, granting you a quick fuck in a motel to see if the Portal to your apprenticeship might open anew). He was the perfect antidote for Hollywood boredom, and a skillful predator for successful girls from dysfunctional families. His leading ladies were, as often happens in these cases, pimping for him, as Amy Wallace describes towards the end of the book. They lied almost as much as their guru - sorry, 'stalked'.Wallace describes all the typical characteristics of the cult: abuse, absolute power for the guru, strict hierarchy, forcing new member to break all bonds with parents and even children, the "privilege" to have sex with the cult leader, the conviction of being among the chosen few, contempt for all the rest of humanity, contempt for the idea of being human, forcing members to abandon human behaviour such as showing affection, a habit of bullying each other, sucking upwards and kicking downwards, excluding and including people for obeying and not obeying instructions, instructions behave like ever smiling robots (quite similar to the Heaven's Gate cult), etc. Predictably, it ended in suicide of the leading members when Castaneda died of cancer - something he had sworn would never happen, because he had been saying that getting cancer is ones own fault. One leading lady drove into the desert, probably expecting some kind of ascension or spontaneous combustion, and died there. Three others vanished and were never found. In the book, the author hears from a leading group member (the 'nagual woman') that they bought guns prior to his death. She decides to stay behind.I first read 140 pages of this book and got discouraged to read the rest. In those 140 pages, I didn't see any magic. It's pretty well written, but Wallace fails to bring across what was so seductive about Castaneda, she depicts him as a conman from the beginning, which is not very smart from a dramatic, storytelling point of view. Another problem is that Amy Wallace herself is really the main character in the book, and she's not the most interesting person walking around in the book. Also... a concussion from banging his head on your energy body? You took that seriously? Really, Amy?Update: I read the end after all, from page 277 onwards, to know more about the events surrounding Castaneda's death. It was badly written, depressing, and showed the real depravity of Casteneda's cult; the sleaziness and nastiness of it. When people try to suppress their humanity, it comes out in worse ways. It describes the death of Castaneda and some events after his death. It is clear that some of Castaneda's harem were preparing to "leave", and Muni, a.k.a. Carol Tiggs, a.k.a. the nagual woman, the one who stayed behind, is quite clear to Wallace about them planning to commit suicide. After his death she confirms to Wallace that all the leading ladies of Castaneda were acting as pimps for him. The nagual woman calls herself, with some pride, "Pimp nr 2", while Florinda Donner was Pimp nr 1. For some reason, Wallace clings to her conviction that she still had a truly romantic relationship with Castaneda, until the end of the book, grabbing onto the distributed moments of real intimacy she shared with him. It's uncanny though to see how all the core members of Carlos harem completely submitted to his every instruction; even when they knew how much bullshit he was telling people, and even though they themselves were spreading the bullshit in abundance. If the success of abusive manipulation is a yard stick for magic, Castañeda was certainly a great magician.Carlos Castaneda's real magic was in his writing, mainly in his first 4 books. After that, his efforts sagged, while his corruption flourished.
Beautifully written, I was in awe of how the author can tell such a huge, timeless story in so few words. It starts out feeling like a fantasy novel or a science fiction book, but it deepens and deepens. SPOILERS FROM HERE. The protagonist is an old magistrate in a colonial settlement who after 30 years of indulgement, comfort, power and servitude to an empire finally feels himself driven to rebel against his employer. His downfall is steep and gruesome. You feel that you've reached the end point of the narrative; but then the book goes on and far beyond. I've read other reviews saying that so little happens. I had the exact opposite feeling. The book is written in refined, sometimes archaic prose, in the voice of the magistrate who presents himself as a well-read man. He is not a very reliable narrator though, especially when he describes his dealings with women; but at other points in the narrative he will show he is quite aware of his self-deception. This book is about the use and abuse of power in all possible ways, about the relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed, which is so much more complicated than people would want it to be. It shows how the abuse of power can turn against the abuser, how an untouchable person can become a nobody, a tormentor can become a victim, a victim can come into a position of power. The wheel of fortune turns. The multifacetedness of unequal and abusive relationships is shown in all its real life dynamics: the "barbarians" vs the empire, the magistrate vs the blind woman he rescues ("rescues", if you will) from the street, the magistrate vs his tormentors. Impermanence, death of the ego, interconnectedness... all Buddhist truths illustrated. The Magistrate becomes both the oppressor and the oppressed, and is in a way an allegory for EveryMan.
After reading Jacob von Gunten, this Dutch translation of The Walk was a huge disappointment. It seems that between 1909 and 1917 Walser changed his style radically. While every sentence in 1909 holds surprises, in The Walk the style is so artificial and ineffectively baroque and embellished, and subject matter so random and often trivial, that reading became homework. There are some very interesting scenes though, and Walsers life story gives the story a very tragic edge.Nevertheless, the essay by WG Sebald and the biography were more interesting than the story itself. The Dutch translation seems to me highly ineffective, it brings out al the flaws of the original (endles ineffective enumerations) and hides all the qualities; when I compared some parts of the original to the translation, I found the original much more elegant, suggestive and consistent in tone. The translation flattens out a lot of purposeful ambivalence of the original text. Original: "Er gesteht ehrlich, dass sein Durst weder mordsmässig noch heidenmässig ist". In English that is roughly "He confesses in earnest that his thirst is not murderously or heathenishly large". But in the Dutch translation the "mord" and "heiden" are flattened into a boring, repetitive enumeration: "not exceptionally or extravagantly large". (niet buitengewoon of buitensporig groot). All in all, I would strongly recommend to read this story in the original German, and i you can't read German, start with Walsers early novels which are wonderful. This is a waste of time..
After the 6th book of the Don Juan series, this book, the seventh, was a pleasant surprise. To summarise: in book 1 (Lessons of Don Juan) to 4 (Tales of Power) Castaneda tells about his training by Don Juan between 1961 and 1972 or 1973, up to the point where Castaneda jumps into an abyss, and Don Juan leaves this world. Book 4 is one of the best, in that it offers great storytelling but also very neatly summarizes the teachings and puts them together.Book 5 has a totally different, much more sinister feel than the previous books. It tells about the time after Don Juan has left the earth: Casteneda meets a group of young sorcerers, becomes their new leader, and together they start remembering that they have a huge shared past that they didn't recall at first. The teachings of Don Juan continue, but are now voiced by La Gorda, to whom Don Juan apparently left an infinite amount of detailed instructions. Book 6, the Eagle's Gift, expands on this. It turns out that all that was said in book 1 to 4 about the years 1960-1973, were only half of what actually happened. Book 1 to 4 cover only what was taught in "right side awareness". From there on, the books are about what was taught in "left side awareness". Castaneda starts remembering all the other teachings he received, and the numerous people involved in it. There's a lot of sexuality and violence. In the meanwhile, books 5 and 6 introduce a lot of new concepts: stalking, dreaming, gazing, loosing the human from, the double or the other, not doing, etc. Most of these words are written in italics in the book, to signify that they have different meanings than in daily usage. It's a rather messy mix-up of characters and relationships and ideas, that often feels totally random to me.But Book 7, the Fire from Within, is very different. For one thing, instead of the story being centered on characters and their relationships, it's basically one huge recollection of a long series of lectures by Don Juan. It's a lot like book 4 in that it offers a clear theoretical framework and summarizes all the teachings and techniques that were discussed in book 5 and 6. Stalking, dreaming and intending are pinpointed as the three techniques that warriors or seeers use. The central concept in this book is the "assemblage point", which is something like the bright shiny focus point of awareness on the "luminous egg" of energy that every person is supposed to be. The whole book is about how you can learn to move that assemblage point, and by doing that assemble and access other worlds, create a dreaming body or double, come into contact with other kinds of beings (such as the ally's), and - in the end - realize the totality of oneself. A lot of concepts and events from the previous books come back here, and are put into the new framework. It feels very nice and orderly. For example, we learn that there are 48 bands of emanations from the Eagle, from which all possible worlds can be constructed. 1 of these bands contains all the organic living creatures on earth, including people. There are also 7 inorganic bands with life forms we can see only when we become "seeers" and learn to shift our assemblage point at will. Etc. It's pretty interesting and I like the constructional clarity of it all. If you don't take the "luminous eggs" literally, the idea of a center of consciousness that assembles its own world from a bundle of Gods (the Eagle's) emanations, still rings true. It matches the teachings of Buddhism, where consciousness is what creates the world. The theoretical framework also gives an interesting explanation for mystical experiences and why people who have a vision of God, often see *him* as a person.The need to loose self-importance reflects an insight that can be found in every religion, especially in monastic orders. But also in the Buddhistic idea of non-self. What's unique to the religious system of Castaneda, is the importance of stalking, which is a very unsympathetic concept to me: it's basically manipulation by acting and pretense. But it's given a higher meaning here, as being a major technique to shift the assemblage point and an important tool for teaching. It's the only idea that really doesn't fit into the precepts of Buddhism - which strictly forbid lying.For some reason, the idea of "impeccability" really landed with me, while I was reading this, I find it kind of motivating. In literary terms this book is no match for some of the best books of the series, but as a textbook it's pretty cool and it helps to sieve out and clarify the useful concepts of the previous books.Clearly, it's also an important step towards what came later: the Tensegrity system of magical passes, which is supposed to be a direct, physical technique to manipulate energy within the "luminous egg" and work with the assemblage point.
In the first 4 Castaneda books, women hardly play a role, there's only the silly skirmish with "La Catalina". In book 4 (Tales of Power), Castaneda seems to acknowledge this, when he makes a comment about the possibility of female "warriors". It seems Castaneda wanted to make up for that. This book is full of women, who wind up more or less as Casteneda's harem. There's a lot of sexual tension in this book, very unlike the first 4 books. The book is also much darker: there are several real murder attempts by the women on Casteneda, which I think reflects his attitude towards and fear of women.In the first 4 books, everything is about learning from nature: water spirits, mist spirit, power in the wind, power animals, power plants, etc. Now it's suddenly all about power struggles between people, who have to steal each other's power by killing each other. The book gets really dark here: all people are apparently parasites or predators. We are supposed to believe that having children creates a dark hole in your being which can never be repaired; if you want to be a warrior and sorcerer, you have to cut yourself loose from your children, abandon your attachment to them, and steal back the power that they have taken from you by being born; thereby condemning them to a life of civilian mediocrity, because they now lack the magical power to become a sorcerer. Yes, that is really what Castaneda teaches. In the first 4 books Castaneda kept hammering in that it is extremely dangerous to receive power from the wind, let your attention drift away with the water, etc. But here the fighting gets real, with the women trying to kill Castaneda a few times, before eventually joining forces with him. No sex, though. The women lift their skirts up a lot to show what they've got, they lie in beds with Castaneda a lot, they embrace in a foursome or even nibble on Casteneda's side or face, but somehow it never ends in real sex. It all sounds really like an allegory of Casteneda's own life. The first women, Soledad, which means loneliness, could represent the loneliness that Casteneda found in the first years of his success. He became a recluse and then surrounded himself with 4 female admirers. He tried to get a woman for every wind; south, east, west, north. Just like in the book.La Gorda, the leading girl, basically replaces Don Juan, who has disappeared into the "nagual", the land of magic behind ordinary reality. Or Imagination Land. La Gorda carries out an endless amount of instructions, given by Don Juan before he left. It just goes on and on, it's quite amazing how detailed Don Juan's instruction to La Gorda must have been.Apart from the violence and the sexual suggestion, Castaneda keeps doing what he did before: rehashing the teachings, changing them and adding new stuff to it on the fly, basically rewriting his textbook of Mexican sorcery again and again, attributing endles new teachings to Don Juan in retrospect, "remembering" things about Don Juan he never mentioned before, dropping earlier ideas, introducing new ones as his fancy tickles him. It think the idea of what an "ally" constitutes changed at least three times in the book series up to now. In addition to "looking" and "seeing", he now adds "gazing", which was never mentioned before but now becomes very important, an aid and extension to "dreaming". Gazing starts with looking at heaps of dry leaves for 4 years, but of course, it can also be learnt in an hour's session. Also, Castaneda introduces the concept of "stalking"; here described as focussing all your attention on your own shortcomings, until they fall apart. (In the later books, stalking becomes more about getting what you want by putting on a mask and tricking people). The complete technique is not fully explained yet in this book. Many of the additions and little rules and tricks and things that suddenly have to be done (Put this stick on your forehead and turn 3 times! Careful, or you may die! Oo, there comes the nagual out your nose!) sound completely arbitrary to me. What I like less and less, is the insistence that everything a-man-of- knowledge/sorcerer/warrior/nagual does is mortally dangerous, the idea that everything in life is a fight, the sectarian idea that you have to break all your former relations, the idea that you have to break the bond with your children and steal their power back, etc. It's cute to read about girls running across the walls or hiding their whole body behind their hands, but it's a bit like reading a children's book too. Castaneda knows his writing, but his world-view comes across to me as hostile and denigrating, Darwinistic and reductionistic. The sorcerers who fight each other to death are supposedly a superrace and the rest of humanity is irrelevant. Warriors should not feel compassion and people cannot help each other, is what this book teaches. It all befits a man who chose to live in total isolation, the last 20 years of his life.In this book it's mentioned for the first time that true sorcerers don't die, they just disappear into the Nagual. Castaneda died of liver cancer in his bed. He had definitely had some magic on his hands, but mostly in his writing.
After the disappointing "Journey to Ixtlan", which was a book in limbo between two worlds (anthropology and fiction), Casteneda shows the best of his magic in this book. He completes the fictionalisation of Don Juan and Genaro (it's all "tales" now), revises (and changes) all the previous teachings, puts them all together anew and writes a number of wonderful magical and mystical scenes to illustrate his new syntaxis. We see a great magician with words at work, and as always with the best magicians, you start to wonder if it might be real magic they're performing. The role of Don Genaro becomes much clearer, and Castaneda pulls a few fascinating tricks with doubling up characters and concepts. Apart from the silly but fascinating theory of the warrior's "double", Don Genaro also becomes the full counterpart of Don Juan, Pablito becomes the full counterpart of Castaneda, the nagual becomes the full counterpart of the tonal. It's pretty skillful how Castaneda manages to jostle the concepts and makes everything binary. There are many inconsistencies in the teachings, but Castaneda pulls it off skillfully by creating a mist. The most blatant inconsistency would be that Castaneda needed 13 years of training before he was allowed to hear of the more advanced teachings learned in this book; Don Juan stresses that all the 13 years of training were meant to prepare the totality of his body/mind, rather than his mind. Otherwise, all this knowledge would be mortally dangerous. Nevertheless, the reader, who hasn't done any of the desert walks with Don Juan or witnessed any of the miracles by Don Genaro, can apparently safely digest all the teaching presented just by reading. In the book, the character Castaneda supposedly runs the risk to die of his exposure to the teachings time and time again, but for the reader there is clearly no risk at all. That would be the greatest inconsistency; if you take it literally, it means that the reader cannot learn anything from the book. Which is in itself a brilliant disclaimer on the part of the author. Castaneda is really the white falcon that can never be caught.Anyway, I would almost be compelled to give it 5 stars because of the sense of philosophy, magic and mystic. But the repetitive slapstick, cheap frights, gratuitous insistence that everything witnessed is oh so very dangerous, the guru's rolling on the floor with laughter for no reason, this all diminishes the realness a bit. Nevertheless there's great storytelling, power of suggestion, and a spectacular reveal of the sorcerers' system, an explanation of all that went in three books before. It's a magical and mystical allegory with a lot of Buddhist teachings at the core, I would say. In the end, Castaneda leaves it all undecided, when, after the big jump off the cliff, he finds himself alone.
Although this poetry looks very experimental at first sight, it's very accessible upon reading. It's a collections of mainly personal poems about the position of the lyrical subject as a woman of Korean parents in America and the Netherlands, as a woman in a literary world and university setting dominated by men, as a woman giving birth to a baby in a medical environment that's alien and hostile to her (and again with a man in a noxious role), as a world citizen without a real home, as an intellectual, as an artist, as a person more or less abandoned by her mother. Looking at the poetry, the distribution of text and white space on the page and repetition are the main tools, apart from that it reads almost as prose. It's the combination of highly personal motives, an abundance of literary references, the humor and ingenuity in the construction of many poems, the clarity, the well elaborated personality that is arises in these poems, that makes it such a great read. Although the general approach is clearly deeply rooted in literary experience and although there's a strong cerebral layer in the composition of the book and the poems, there is also a lot of raw emotion and pain underneath; there is sexuality in a vision of T.S. Elliott in the metro, quite a bit of pride, cynicism, resentment, a search for identity. There is a large intellectual world here, combined with a small but intense emotional universe, and the reader gets an close view of both, or as least that is the reading experience. There's a certain sense of hostility to the outside world. Some of it made me laugh out loud, some of it made me foam with anger, some of it brought tears to my eyes, like the last poem in which the I finally constructs or finds a home for herself, a nucleus, inside her poetry, which serves as an inheritance for the next generation, her son - hoping that he will abhorr it esthetically, but nevertheless treasure it as a heirloom like she keeps the horrible souvenir that her parents once gave her... because there is something like a soul in there, a rare proof of unconditional love.
It's a unique book in its combination of absurdism, abstract portrait of the workings of power en bureaucracy, twisted psychology and relationships. To me it's also very much an unfinished book which could really use editing. Some passages are really long and windy where I had to force myself to continue reading. All the characters speak in the same tone of voice, which is a major cause of monotony in some page long dialogues and monologues. Nevertheless the twists and turns of the story are always very entertaining and surprising. At times it's hilarious and I had to laugh out loud. It's somehow deeply disturbed, like the movies of David Lynch. But for a writer of this type, I prefer Robert Walser, who makes every sentence count. This novel leaves too many loose ends. It's not even near finished. Nevertheless the unique absurd caricature of society and personal relationships makes the read a worthwile effort. Incidentally, "The Trial" has a very similar theme and feels more finished. If you enjoyed this, definitely read The Trial.
I found this book interesting mainly for shedding light on Kafka. Written in the same time in the same place as The Castle, it clarified for me how the corrupt and dictatorial Austrian-Hungarian state, which suppressed the Czechs, has been a model for the abstract, unreachable, omnipresent authoritarian bureaucracy in Kafka's work. Also the humor and absurdism resonates in a way. The reading of Part 1 of the adventures of Svejk was a pleasure and the character of Svejk is interesting in his incredible indifference to his fate, but the style is very straighforward (could be the fault of the translation) and I do not feel compelled to read part 2 and 3. I think the beginning of Part 1 which is about the beginning of WW I and the paranoia of the Austrian-Hungarian rulers and the story of Svejk being sent to prisn, is the most interesting. The rest seems just an endless stream of picaresque adventures. It's humorous, but not humorous enough to me to keep reading. Not in this Dutch translation anyway.
All in all, not a very well written book, this one, mostly a dreary read in fact, but inside all the fluff it contains an interesting review of many of Castaneda’s magic concepts like intent, the assemblage point, spirit, stalking, not-doing, etc. There are some cool bits about poetry and storytelling as a way to reveal the workings of magic too. Whether any of the information in this book carries any practical value, remains to be seen. In my opinion, Carlos Castaneda paints a rather misanthropic, psychopathic image of the "warrior" or sorcerer (once called a "man of knowledge" in the first books of the series); by now the man of knowledge has become a person without compassion, who masks that lack of compassion, manipulates other people through 'stalking', breaks his ties with his family, and has no altruistic values whatsoever, just the urge to be in touch with an abstract Spirit, increase his "power", have interesting experiences of the mind, and escape death (being "devoured by the eagle"). Warriors or sorcerers apparently do not have any genuine love relationships and do nothing to contribute to the community. They only search freedom of perception for themselves and their sorcery disciples, and that’s it. An example of the chilling mentality that pervades Castaneda's teaching: when Don Juan willingly takes on the appearance of a demented old man in this book, just for a few hours, Castaneda takes that so seriously that he immediately wants to abandon his guru, in spite of all the years of training and wisdom he received from him. There’s not much love to go 'round.For a general time framework: this book was published in 1987. It supposedly covers time that Castaneda spent in the company of his Yaqui indian teacher Don Juan, between 1960 and 1973. Between 11 to 14 years after his apprenticeship ended, he remembered the specific lessons that were taught to him by Don Juan in this book, which is number 8 in a series of 12 books. It’s interesting to notice that only in book 5, The second ring of power (1977), Castaneda ever discussed what happened after Don Juans departure from earth, and not in any of the later books. In book 5, Castaneda finds the solution to continue Don Juans teaching by word of mouth; a pupil of Don Juan, La Gorda, passes on to Castaneda everything that the guru had instructed. She remembers an amazing amount of detailed oral instructions that go on forever. However, in book 6 Castaneda came up with a new idea that allowed him to go back to Don Juan as the instructor. He 'discovered' that there had actually been an incredible amount of forgotten instructions between 1960 and 1973, which had been provided in a heightened state of consciousness ("left awareness"). From 1981 onwards Castaneda supposedly started remembering all these instructions in the minutest detail, hour to hour, second to second, which gave him the possibility to keep on writing about lessons from Don Juan for 17 more years, until his own death of liver cancer in 1998. Now, about the content of ‘The power of silence’. In this 8th book, Carlos Castaneda continues on the path he set out in book 7, “The fire from within”: he continues to build and change his theoretical framework of magic around the new ideas of the "luminous egg" and "intent". The first six books had a lot of storytelling and interactions between characters, but the 8th book is mostly one big lecture, just like the 7th book. There is some storytelling, but a lot of it is just rehashing of ideas from earlier books. The most interesting new ideas in this book are about the relationship between magic, poetry, language and storytelling, and about the struggle of Reason with "silent knowledge" throughout the history of mankind. What makes this book a real cumbersome read, is all the fluff about how guru Don Juan and his pupil interact, which is dreadfully mechanical and uninspired, repetitive and redundant. What’s left of real storytelling, is flimsy for the most part: Don Juan thinking he is being chased by a monster straight from a badly written children's book, Castaneda being chased by a jaguar. It’s really childish and unimaginative.So, what’s the theory in book 8? It focusses on the idea of shifting the assemblage point, a point in the energetic field of a human being (the ‘luminous egg’) which was described extensively in book 7. The assemblage point is supposed to be somewhere behind our back, at shoulder height. By shifting it, one can see other parts of reality, or even completely different realities which are beyond ordinary comprehension. According to Castaneda, moving the assemblage point can even cause real shapeshifting (although Castaneda often casts a bit of doubt on any supernatural events he describes, and leaves it up to the reader to decide if he really believes in them). The book also expands on ‘stalking’, which Castaneda previously described as one of the three main techniques of sorcerers (dreaming, stalking and intending - sorcerers are either "dreamers" who have a knack for controlling and using dreams; or "stalkers" who are most apt at using and controlling behaviors; while intending is important for all sorcerers). Stalking is basically the art of masking your intentions and doing the unexpected, even to oneself. “Controlled folly” is one of the possibilities of stalking, and is a method for “stopping the world” or “non-doing”. It can take on the meaning of diminishing your own self-importance. (one of the main activities in Castaneda's real life cult was destroying other member's 'self-importance', i.e. breaking down their sense of self-worth by bullying them.)If you are destined to become a sorcerer, (which shows itself in the magical world as having a double or fourfold energy body or 'luminous egg') fate or ‘intent’ will make itself known to you in 4 steps, says Castaneda: (1) it will give signs to an experienced sorcerer who will notice you; (2) you will become aware of intent and make a connection link to that phenomenon; (3) intent (through the workings of the nagual or master sorcerer) will use 'stalking' to trick you into becoming a dedicated pupil and establishing a firmer connection link; (4) you will directly experience the spirit, or intent, in a revelatory experience.The terms ‘stopping the world’ and ‘the art of non-doing’ from earlier books are briefly revisited, terms which basically involve doing the completely unexpected or illogical, to break through the conventional course of events in human interactions - this is one of the ways to shift the assemblage point. In his method of expanding and changing his theoretical framework of magic over time, Castaneda has a writing technique he applies frequently: he introduces new synonyms or near synonyms of common words and attributes a magical meaning to them, nitpicking about the differences between “moving” and “shifting” the assembly point, or between "looking", “seeing” and “gazing” in earlier books. Sometimes the new terms stick, but very often they are later abandoned again, in favour of new ideas. E.g. in the first books, it was all about having "allies", but they have completely vanished by book 8. Same for "gazing". A lot of this book is about defining and redefining all the terminology that Castaneda has introduced and keeps on introducing. The shift of the assemblage point in the energy body can be accomplished in several ways, says this book: for normal people, it can occur spontaneously when they are ill, for example, but the sorcerer seeks the shift of the assembly point on purpose, because it is the essence of magic, according to Castaneda. To be able to do this, the sorcerer needs to break down his "self-reflection" or inflated sense of self, similar to how in Buddhism the idea of having a fixed self is deconstructed.There’s a lot in this book about ‘intent’, which is a force similar to Schopenhauers “will”, which pervades the universe, and is closely linked to the idea of destiny and life purpose. Intent is actually what *causes* awareness, says Castaneda in this book. (This follows the Buddhist idea of dependent origination). The sorcerer needs to re-establish a good connection link to intent, which will help him to shift his assemblage point and access other modes of perception. There are several ways to do this. Alas, the mechanical workings of our dominant Reason obscure our link to intent.According to Castaneda (or Don Juan, or the Toltecs) human history has seen two basic positions of the assemblage point in humans: one in a state of silent knowledge (the power of silence), where people would have knowledge that couldn’t be put into words; and one governed by reason or ratio, where words and stories are needed to describe wisdom, but also eclipse it. In this book Castaneda introduces a “third” position of the assemblage point, which is the position of the magician who can go back and forth between assemblage point positions or be at two positions at the same time – also in the physical sense. So the magician is different from all people that ever lived.One of the sillier parts of this book (there are several) is about sorcerers using the "shine" in their eyes to beckon intent - literally! According to Castaneda, when a sorcerer reaches a state where he is completely devoid of compassion, both to himself and to others, this will show in his eyes getting really shiny - yes, shiny. And this shine communicates directly with intent and beckons it... So, children, if you want to establish a good link to intent, you must abandon all compassion and become implacable!Some other ideas from the book that may be interesting or tell you something about Castaneda’s views:• From the perspective of the spirit, it is the sorcerer’s task to improve the connection link to intent; this is the essence of magic.• There are only three kinds of people, according to Castaneda: (1) kind and friendly people, who like to help and serve others, but have little initiative; (2) egoistic, mean, bad-tempered people, who want to be independent at all times; and (3) indifferent people, who feel independent but lack initiative, waiting for things to happen. Castaneda puts himself in the second category.• The nagual/sorcerer does not set his own goals, but lets “intent” reveal itself to him, and then follows it in an impeccable way.• A sorcerer must relinquish his self-esteem at all cost. • The "third reference point" (of the assemblage point) is a term synonymous to freedom of perception, "intent", "spirit", "the abstract", or a "summersault of thought into the miraculous".• A sorcerer needs to die a symbolic or semi-death to earn his ticket to impeccability, i.e. the continuity of his old life must be broken. (in previous books and in real life, Castaneda instructs followers to break relations with their parents and even children)• The place where there is no pity/compassion is one of the locations of the assembly point, that leads to silent knowledge. The nagual / sorcerer must be without compassion, both with himself and with others; he is implacable, but masks it. His implacability is not cruelty, says Castaneda, but the absence of self-pity.• The nagual/sorcerer may mask his pitilessness, his absence of compassion with a mask of reason, nitpicking, or playfulness, in order to ‘stalk’ other people or pupils (i.e. trick them, e.g. to help them move their assembly point) (in other words, he acts like a full-blown psychopath)• The spirit only listens when sorcerers offer deeds of surrender and greatness, deeds that show silent knowledge.• Stalking is trickery meant to create a shock, with others or within yourself, as a way to ‘stop the world’ and give intent opportunity to manifest itself, and/or access different positions of the assemblage point.• The sorcerer can use poetry to stalk himself, because poets feel intent intuitively, although they cannot work with it.• Dreamers need to conserve their sexual energy, stalkers do not.• To move the assemblage point to the point of silent knowledge, one most cut the chains of self-reflection (self-obsession), be impeccable, and manage energy wisely, in order to increase it. A lot of energy is needed for moving the assemblage point around.
The 3d book of the Don Juan series is a disappointment after the first two. The real magic here is that Carlos Castaneda managed to get a PhD with this book. That's just incredible. The last two or three chapters are worthwile though. This book is all about death and fear of death. Fear of death is mainly found in nature, in this book. The main message of the book is: you're gonna die before you know it, and you should live life with the constant awareness of your impending death, because that will give much more significance to your acts and choices. The book is not a disappointment because there are no drugs in it, but because it's so much worse written than "A separate reality", so much less believable, so repetitive. What's particularly annoying, is how Carlos Castaneda changed the character of Don Juan in this book. Writing about supposedly the same time episode (1960-1962) as in the first book, he gives Don Juan a completely different character: Don Juan becomes a caricature of a guru who has only 2 modes of communication: very stern and serious, or rolling on the floor with laughter because he finds his pupil so funny and silly. He turns Don Juan into a guru clown in this book. A lot of chapters are quite childish and consist of endless walking in the desert with a parade of scares such as mist, thunder, shadows, noises, etc, which are given a transcendent or threatening meaning. It gets really boring halfway the book and I had to force myself to continue reading. Most ideas like "stopping the world" and "not-doing" are thinly veiled derivations of the idea of "non-ado" and "dissolving the ego" of Tao and Buddhism, but Castanada makes them vague and childish. In the end it boils down to making a car disappear, a typical magicians act. I got the feeling Castaneda is not taking his readers seriously in this book anymore and ran out of actual research data. The role that Castaneda puts on as a sceptical non-believer (while the sorcerers keep delivering 'proof' after 'proof' that the normal world is not as it seems) becomes very annoying after a while. The story of La Catalina, the witch opponent, is really a bit of a children's book. Only in the last 2 or 3 chapters the story becomes interesting again, with a touch of magic, at least from a literary point of view. The lesson of Don Genaro, that a person who becomes a sorcerer (or, in Buddhistic terms, an enlightened person) can never really return home, is a bit of beautiful drama and must reflect Casteneda's feeling as a Peruvian emigrant. All the previous chapters seem to have been constructed by Castaneda without much imagination, just to elucidate his belief system which consists of ideas such as breaking with your past, taking responsibility for your choices, finding a worthy adversary, stopping all the beliefs and convictions that parents and society have imbued in you at the most basic level ('stopping the world'), and vague notions such as "hunting for power", which basically means going on long walks and spend time in nature to restore your energy... but with a touch of imagined scare and magic. The book has a great finale though. While reading it became increasingly clear that Castaneda constructs the teachings to match his own curriculum and personality. In the final chapter he comes up with the coyote, who is known as a trickster, as his totem animal. So he is not really hiding what he is doing. What he stresses again and again, is that there is really no difference between common reality and personal imagined worlds. If he really believes that, it makes sense that he presents his literary world as factual.But, in its essence, this book is about dealing with fear of death.
A great book for older children, I assume. I started reading, thinking it was a fantasy novel for adults, and a such I was a bit disappointed. It does not have the depth and feeling of total submersion in another world that Lord of the Rings offered. After the dragon Smaug, the dragon Yevaud is a bit two-dimensional. The same goes for the characters that Ged meets. The Jungian symbolism of a boy chasing a shadow was obvious so the end had no surprise. Still, the scenery is great, the ideas about language as a vessel of magic are inspiring, and the way a big adventure is brought to life in very few words, is cool. I wish I had read this when I was 13.
Technically, this is probably a great translation. As such it is well suited for instruction. The main problem is that it's written and printed like a computer program: all the repetitive parts are only mentioned once and then the reader is expected to go back there for every repetition, substituting some relevant words for other words. This breaks the rhythm of reading and really turns the book into a puzzle. For students of Pali this version will be useful, because the Pali and English text are adjacent almost word by word. For experiencing or reciting the message of the Boeddha, it is unfortunately not practical, unless you put in a lot of extra effort.
I just love all the books by Torgny Lindgren. This one is about a quest, a search for the ultimate recipe for "pölsa", which is something like blood sausage, hash, scrapple, a dish for the poor made from offals. This search becomes like a quest for the holy grail, the recipe of life. It's also a book about storytelling and truth: what matters more? It's just beautiful, humorous and there is so much meaning and depth under the words. Pure genius.
The best thing about this book is definitely the title. It claims to be different from all other self help books but it isn't really. It does tell you what's supposedly wrong with your life and it does proceed to suggest a way out. It's, of course, not about "not giving a fuck", it's about giving a fuck about fundamental values and making choices. Which is a bit of a pity, because it doesn't deliver what it promises. But it also makes sense. The book discusses what kind of values are essential and is primarily based on a buddhist view of life, which builds on awareness of mortality and the willingness to bear suffering. I took a few interesting insights from the book, mainly that ambition is not about the ability or desire to achieve a goal, but about the amount of pain you're willing to bear in the process of getting there (or not getting there). The other inspiration i took from the book is the value "do something" rather than doing nothing. Because you can do a lot of nothing after death. The book is written in a way that makes it very easily digestible, but is also quite sloppy, with the author contradicting himself frequently, sometimes on the same page.The author does not seem to fully acknowledge that his current values are only possible and solid because he had different values (and an according lifestyle) when he was younger. It's like a person who has smoked for 30 years and finally quit, telling all the people around him aggressively not to smoke. Nevertheless everybody can probably find some valuable lesson or other in this book - like in most self help books. Nevertheless I think it's badly overrated.
Mind expanding. One of the most original books of mankind. But read the translation by John Wu, it's very good and poetic.
This is the kind of book I would not have picked up, were it not recommended to me by my beloved, so I read it. It reads like a breeze and gives a lighthearted, encouraging view on living a life with art and creation. I think it's great encouragement for people who feel a desire to create art but are held back by all kinds of convictions about themselves or their surroundings. One magical idea of the book is that artistic idea's lead a live on their own, and that they search for human beings to channel them. If they visit you, you are the right person to catch them and work with them (although that is no guarantee for succes at all - the book is very clear on the fact that you can not control your succes and should never count on it or make that your purpose - you have to focus on creating what needs to be created, for the sake of creation - and work hard at it too, and finish it). "Genius" is not something you can be... it's something that visits you. There's the magic part. A lot of the book is a coherent view that is exactly the opposite of the widespread view that art is suffering, and the conviction of many artists that being an artist is painful, should be painful, and isn't worth much if it isn't painful. Gilbert pleads for the artist as a trickster. ("ritselaar" said the Dutch translation). It's a useful counterbalance to the cliché romantic view of the artist as a martyr. I guess they can both be true. Most artists I know, create art from a source of suffering; but there are plenty of artists too who can only create art when they feel balanced and happy at the moment of creation. One thing that annoyed me a little in the book, is the part about art education and money; Gilbert pushes a bourgeois conviction that one should have a job next to creating art, that one should not get a student loan to study arts, or try to earn a living by creating art alone, unless the money is really flowing in by truckloads - Gilbert proudly mentions she only gave up her daytime jobs after her fifth book (Eat Pray Love) made her - I assume - a multi-millionaire. Gilbert either has a suppressed, deeply ingrained sense that art, in the end, is useless for society and should be a hobby, or she has an extreme need for financial security that she projects onto other people. There are numerous Nobel-prize winning authors who created their best work in debt and poverty. The book would breathe more freedom, if she was equally open-minded materially as spiritually.
Quite interesting, especially the case of Sweden's horrifying involvement and support of this extremely murderous regime which continued for a long time after the Khmer Rouge were dispelled. Which is mainly to blame on the incredible dictator-worshipping idiot Jan Myrdal. This book makes you really hate the man. Well researched. The very fragmented structure is a bit annoying though.
"'Prevention of cruelty' talk cuts ice in townWhere they consider death unnaturalBut on well-run farms pests have to be kept down.""Six grown men with gaping mouths and eyesBursting the sockets like spring onions in drills.Six wrecks of bone and pallid, tautened skin.'Bia, bia, bia.'"I should probably give this book 4 stars for the excellent composition, or 5 because of the Irish history in the background, but I had such high expectations that I was rather disappointed in the individual poems, and chose to disagree with the masses. This debut is well composed: it starts with a poetical statement and youth memories of growing up in the country side, moves to Ireland's central trauma (British abuse and the Great Hunger, which was more or less a genocide), goes on to a love story that ends in solid marriage in only 7 poems and ends with a few poems about odd subjects, returning to the subject of poetry itself in the end. For a 27 year old, this is a remarkably balanced, mature and complete introduction to the poet and the country. But many of the poems were so boring. Heaney is a very traditional poet who mostly describes rural activities in great detail, never straying an inch from day to day reality. This poet is all about concrete and practical details. There's very little irony, absurdism, abstraction or flights of fancy. There is a depth of feeling though and a deeper hidden meaning. Many poems contain some level of violence or threat, and the central poems about the Famine supercharge that theme. Most poems take one situation and follow it through to the end with stern practicality, but little surprise, until the last lines, where they often end with a punchline. The form is traditional, with more or less regular stanza's, rhythm and rhyme; but the rhyme is oblivious of syllable emphasis; garden rhymes with hen, breaking with ring. I find that unappealing. The rhythm is also unreliable. There are some great poems. The poetry in general draws its greatest strength and poignancy from the dramatic background of Irelands history. The two poems about the great hunger are the strongest in my opinion, they carry the whole book. Most impression on me made "For the Commander of the Eliza", about the horrifying British policies during the Great Hunger; this is the least traditional poem in the book, basically a piece of poetic prose. Restraint is a great quality of Seamus Heaney, often suggesting a dark (or bright) reality behind the factual details. But all in all, I found many poems too slow and lacking of surprise. This is poetry for people who look at the world in terms of weight, size and colour, not in terms of ideas.
A wonderful treatise of the workings of power and the hypocrisy of cult leaders who feel that they are the chosen one. This book shows King David as what he probably really was: a narcissistic, mythomaniac dictator.
This is a rhythmical and well-sounding translation of the Maha Satipatthana Sutta, suitable for chanting or reciting in a group. The book looks and feels great. All the repetitious elements that characterise the Buddha's speeches are written out and the language is accessible. The translation is not very precise in meaning sometimes, it has a preference for day-to-day meaning. In this sense, this is probably not the best translation for instruction. For that, I think the translation by Bhante Kusala, which I also reviewed, is better; but that is unfit for chanting. The translation by The Vipassana Research Institute (S.N. Goenka) is also more instructional and has great explanations. The difference of approach sometimes lead to widely differing interpretations. Two examples:(1)Thero translates: "In this way he dwells contemplating his own body, he dwells contemplating others' bodies // He dwells contemplating the arising of the body, he dwells contemplating the passing away of the body"Kusala translates: "In this way he remains observing internally in the body; he remains observing externally in the body // He remains observing on the nature of arising in the body; he remains observing on the nature of passing away in the body"Thero's translation seems more intuitive for layman, but Kusala's translation is more what vipassana is about - as far as I know.(2)Thero translates: "Mindfullness, that there is a body, is simply established in him to the extent necessary for higher knowledge and mindfulness. He dwells independent, and not clinging to anything in the world."Kusala translates: "His mindfulness that "there is a body" is established in him; to the extent necessary for bare knowledge; for the purpose of continuous mindfulness; and he remains unassociated; not clinging to anything in the world." "He dwells independent" is poetic, somewhat romantic, makes the meditator sound like a happy drifter. But "He remains unassociated" is deeper and more precise.
this is one of the best books ever. it used to be my bible, i learned so much from it.it's full of amazing quotes.
Pretty straight forward
Easy read
Finger licking good
Beautifully written and illustrated. All familiar names and stories come from ages ago. This book can't be only for kids. There are some books I'm sure adults enjoy more them than kids.
This is a coursebook. Kinda. Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Endocrinology etc all in one. The book shows how processed food makes us unhealthy very scientifically. Lustig is a pediatric endocrinologist with 40 years clinical experience. He is witness of all metabolic syndromes in kids over the decades. He shows the reader what's problem and why is problem and how can it be solved on every level, it involves politics, laws, insurance, pharmacy, academics.. very comprehensive yet very basic explanations. Some notes from the book;"If you buy your organic, all natural, GMO-free tortilla chips at Whole Foods, you're still stuffing your liver and starving your gut - you're just paying more for the privilege.""A calorie is not a calorie" (you need to read book to understand what it means)"Caloric restriction; you don't live longer, it just feels that way."
I enjoy this sort of books but at one point it begins to become boring to read same sugar-coated sentences. Monotonously repeating suggestions; what should we listen when we commute, which scented candles are best at home for the afternoons etc. Though I've jotted down some ideas and I've found useful some parts I can't give more than 2 stars to be honest.
Nice illustrations, enjoyable story. Favorite era, favorite place. For me that was good enough to give 4 stars.
A real literature for me. Rich with words, dialects and also it gives an insight to modernization beginning from the last century.
It convinced me to give it a try. Actually I've already begun to fast while I've been reading this book. Before I was very suspicious about it. I'm now very motivated for my fasting experience. The trick is everybody's fasting is different. The book has also a chapter consists of recipes which I think "delicious but not doable".
I enjoyed this character; Eleanor Oliphant. And it ended in an unexpected way for me. Eleanor’s transformation was quite nice.
%40 of the book is about healthy food. The ideas and even the very similar sentences were not unfamiliar to me since I've already read Lustig's last book; Metabolical. Lustig is my man. He convinced me enough so I've could given up sugar. That was a huge thing for me. I will try the recipes for sure. But this is not a diet book, this is healthy food book. It consists of every kind of recipes and yes desserts too.
It's not directly about minimalism. Minimalism is a tool to live a meaningful life and how do you live meaningfully. That's the subject. The first version of this book was too long say the authors, so it was not minimalist at all and this final version is supposed to be short. Yes short, yet so many repetitive statements there are. It's written more than a decade ago. Some health claims are not true I suppose, like drinking juice etc.. I'm happy about the authors they changed their way of living in only 2 years and at such a young age. It's not easy for everyone to notice what's wrong in their life and take an action.
Great action scenes, mildly boring story line and even more boring characters. Quite the disappointment after the mistborn trilogy...
Fascinating take on resolving the Fermi Paradox. Prisoner's dilemma in and around the galaxy :)
Rating based on nostalgia.
Beep boop beep. My algorithms have determined the rating for this short story.
** spoiler alert ** Interesting though by now somewhat outdated premise, boring protagonist.
Proto-what?
Nasty, brutish and short.
Orwell's inspiration. Not an easy read and has quite a few tropey chars, but interesting nonetheless.
** spoiler alert ** Improves upon The Circle, though characters and their motivations follow typical tropes.
The subtitle says it all.
** spoiler alert ** Alt history detective depicting the facade of a victorious Nazi Germany and the semi-hidden secret of the Holocaust
Ondanks de cringeworthy titel zeker prima voor het type boek: "So wanting to change the world for changing the world's sake is usually just bullshit social virtue signalling driven by social media and groupthink and rewarded with some kind of philanthropic social currency"+"achieving all of our goals is what ultimately leads to chaos and satisfaction"+ "motivation is a poorly described concept that has been largely defined by those with an incentive to depict it in a certain way"
Unfortunately, quite a few aspects reverberate. Favourite read.
"The profession of almost every man, even the artist, begins with hypocrisy, as he imitates from the outside"
Unique ideas by Liu imbued with a blend of PRC history* with Saganesque elements (esp. Contact), with a pinch of Clarke added for good measure. * = led to an hour-long sesh of digging through history about the PRC, Red Guards, Cultural Revolution, &c.
Not my genre. Unremarkable characters, full of tropes.
Interesting as a historical artifact. First read as a 14-year-old because it was 'banned' (not exactly, though). Incoherent ramblings galore.
** spoiler alert ** Nickel Boys - a gripping tale of how the life of the black protagonist in this book is ruined by institutionalised racism and how he deals with his MLK-inspired idealism in a world of cruelty
Interesting quote "[An American] is either an European (sic) or the descendant of a European, hence the strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country." + Something about leaving behind "ancient prejudices and manners" (obviously excluding many immigrants and enslaved people)
Tour de Force of metaphors, idioms and allusions that gets tiring after a while, though the social dynamics are well-integrated in a plot focused on individual experiences.
Utter trash based on survivor bias.
** spoiler alert ** Allegory for cultural assimilation / adaptation / subordination in a scifi dystopian setting. Using avatars to hide your true identity, in the end thereby losing your own sense of self. A hopeful open-ended tale.
Important read, but unremarkable narratively speaking .
"But nothing is lasting in this world. Even joy begins to fade after only one minute. Two minutes later, and it is weaker still, until finally it is swallowed up in our everyday, prosaic state of mind, just as a ripple made by a pebble gradually merges with the smooth surface of the water."
DNF, but interesting themes of (proto-)racial/class issues of Saxon vs Norman identity might warrant future inquiry.
Childhood's End (1953) - interesting to read one of the founding fathers of modern science fiction's take on how humanity might respond to alien 'Overlords' arriving and ruling a so-called 'Utopia'.
The Midnight Library - I've often wondered what a different life might look like. Would I be happier? Or, would more depressive episodes have taken over? And how do you live a life worth living? Some serious themes but with a light-hearted undertone.
Sometimes underdeveloped characters in a thought-provoking setting.
#DNF but i’m behind on my reading challenge so…
I have no tears left to cry.
** spoiler alert ** The author did Grayson dirty.
Read this in Mongolia 🇲🇳✨
Underrated.Loved the character development Vasya went through, and ofc Morozko who is such a cutie (love him).Tbh, I think this book deserves the same praise/fame as “famous” booktok books.
The writing style was just ✨indecipherable✨Did not finish. Couldn’t relate to 19th century garbage. Sending my best west wishes to all the students who have to make an essay about this book. …🏃‍♀️
Loved this!!
** spoiler alert ** 4.5The Brunswick kid story was just 🤌Rest in peace.
** spoiler alert ** The only reason I gave it one star is because Vee is happy with her Gavin. But Nora does not deserve Patch. I do. Nora is an evil bitch!!
The main character needs severe help.
The characters suck:(
Was supposed to give: enemies to loversInstead it gave: lovers to lovers😭
Boring asf
** spoiler alert ** I cried at every death.
Wow. I have no words. This was beautiful and I cried so hard.
2.5Good plot, although it was a bit boring at times:(
Uhmm idk a rating…This book made me cry so that means that it is good i guessThe ending tho! Wtf was that?! The book just randomly stopped. Disappointing
I’ve read all the books in the Hunger Games trilogy and and I enjoyed those books a lot. However I’m very disappointed at this book. It’s so boring and the “chemistry” between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray is just not there. I liked the end tho.
4.75Great book.Spice rate:🌶 1/2To Mariam: due to the fact that the ✨spice✨ is almost nonexistent, this book is Inge approved for Nour☑️
Fun little family history drama with a bit of a sci-fi twist. While I was reading it I was thinking about the Raw Shark Texts and how maybe this would be a time travel version of that where the character actually lives on the paper that I was holding in my hand. But alas, it turned out the novel was more about the main character coming to terms in the relationship with his father. The sci-fi was more conceptual than I would normally be into.Still, it was kinda fun for a bit, so it still gets some stars for the review.
I loved it, loved it, loved it. I'll probably be recommending this book to many people over the coming weeks and months. Well, this and the initial book in the trilogy of course.A strong second book in the three-body trilogy, I was enamored with the entire thing. I really loved how the various threads of the book pull together and apart as the story hurtles into the future. Each of the Wallfacer's with their specific plans, all taking advantage of a different part of humanity and human civilization. I especially enjoyed how one particular wallfacer decided that it was important to find happiness, and mustered the world's resources to do so. I almost thought that was a connection to the third chapter and how the entire world seemed to change, but it was not. Something else was set in motion which was quite interesting.This is one of those books that I feel so lucky to have just experienced for the first time. I can't wait to talk to others who may have just read it for the first time soon. Someday.
What an epic journey of reading this trilogy of science fiction books has been. Epic in scope, playful with scale and just enough charm to keep the humanity in there throughout all the galactic politics and warfare. I'm gonna remember this book and the two previous volumes for the rest of my life, so I don't need to get into detail here, but I can't really give this a higher recommendation. Read the trilogy if you haven't yet!
This was a really great little read. Especially topical for me as I've been preparing wood for the winter myself. I've learned a few little things from this book that I might try to apply in the future (Fell trees in the spring as opposed to fall, light the fire from the top down), and I also completely understand the joy that the author expresses in looking at a well stacked woodpile. There are many passages throughout the book that communicate this feeling if you've never experienced it yourself. Beyond the philosophical and life fulfillment aspects related to using wood as a heat source, there are some clever little jokes peppered throughout the book that I really enjoyed. Dry Scandinavian Humour indeed.Very much enjoyed this book and I'd consider it a must read for anyone who spends any amount of time in the countryside during the winter.
Great read. A solid and thorough scientific perusal of all the studies that have been done on sleep. Why we do it, why is it important, what is it made out of. I really enjoyed it and I will prioritize things that make me sleep on into the future, although I've personally been pretty good about that so far. when you read this book you'll actually be a bit frightened by what a lack of sleep can do to not just you, but to the general population in our society, although I think the author makes a good case that we can be optimistic of the coming technological developments which will be made to make our sleep better than ever.In any case, definitely recommended reading.
Multi-dimensional chinese science fiction. Enjoyed it so thoroughly I will probably keep this review short. I ordered the next two books in the series already and can't wait to read them too.It's interesting to read a science fiction book from a chinese author that considers the concept of scale but on a civilizational level. I think China has typically had a longer term mentality which lends itself well to this kind of story. I think it's also great that they delve into lower dimensions, the micro and the macro, of matter itself. Are there analogies for micro and macro when one speaks about civilizations? Maybe, it's possible. It'll be something I'll think about as I go about my daily life and wait for the next volumes in the trilogy to arrive.If it wasn't clear from my review, this book is a must-read. Classic science fiction in a modern format. I very very much enjoyed it.
A truly great book to read. I loved it. The experimental nature of the setup and the writing lends itself well to the themes I was going through in my head while I was reading it. It's obviously a meditation on loss, death, grief and all that comes with it, but I also found it to an interesting exploration into the wider sense of humanity and all of the different perspectives brought to bear on all of our problems. The backdrop of the American Civil War and the occasional chapters which used small snippets from actual accounts of what was happening the real world gave the book it's grounding, while the conversation and activity of all of the others in their middle of the journey stories gave the book it's momentum and magical nature.Easily the best book I've read in a couple of years. Highly recommended.
Nice quick read. Like his other books that I've failed to read, the language moves quickly from concept to idea to action to moment to observation. I have looked at some notes following the read and this book has made me think a lot. About America. About the culture around communication. About the world on drugs. About #MeToo. I wasn't really sure why, but the fact that the main character is a woman and has all these weird interactions with men of all types kinda struck me as out-dated, but somehow it still seems to work because she wins most of the time.Really thoughtful and enjoyable post-read. Not really recommended for someone that wants a clear and easy plot. I think I'll enjoy reading literary criticism and interpretation of this one for a little while yet.
Salacious, easy, childish fun. Possibly the best beach read ever. It’s like a children’s book but for adults. Absolutely loved it and will recommend it highly to anyone!
Pretty great sci-fi. I thought the first 200 pages or so were a little bit weak, but once it got going I wasn't quite sure where it was gonna end up. It remained pretty satisfying and I didn't mind the ending that was revealed only within the last 10 or 20 pages.Good stuff. I might read the next ones in the series.
The second novel of this series was also fantastic. Although it loses the structure of the first novel, it builds on some really amazing ideas and creates a very cool, very space opera appropriate world and then tells a really interesting story within it. All the characters felt so familiar due to the great introduction they had in Hyperion. I also enjoyed the ending and I'm now kind of excited to read the next books in the series.
Great simple memoir. Illustrates clearly how so much of a successful business can really just come down to luck and timing. Strategy and execution feed into that of course, but when you go behind the veil of these kinds of successful companies, it's pretty crazy how little certainty and confidence there can be sometimes. Very enjoyable and easy read. Nothing too earth shattering but I liked it.
Clear, concise, thorough biography of an interesting character, celebrity and creative mind from the 20th century. I didn't really know quite how prolific the director was but it seems like he just had a momentum in his work that kept him on to project after project after project. I wonder how much time he had for reading books and finding all of those projects. Seems like he must have always had something being read along the side.The biography itself was well written, if a bit short and sometimes seeming dry, but I think that would be appropriate for the subject matter. Hitchcock himself seems like he was quite a character and this book pulls that out just enough for it to be entertaining. nice read.
Possibly one of the best self-help book I've ever read. Existential but in the best possible contemplative ways. This really made me think about time and time management and the false hope of being able to get things done. I think my favorite lesson in the book was about Patience and how that actually helps one get the most important things done.Great to read and I will surely recommend this one to many people
Great concept for sure, and also a decent and easy to read book. I only take away a star because I think the book sings so many praises for Apple so you can tell it's from a different time. All that being said, I will start to ask Why much more often on all of my projects.
Quite Thoroughly enjoyed this one. I make a habit of reading books that make sense within the context of my life. With this book, it's hard to say if it's that great of a book or that it just works so well within the context of my personal enjoyment of mindfulness meditation as a daily practice.Still, I appreciate what the author is trying to do here and I like that the book reads like an extended exploration of the fundamentals of buddhist practice while attempting to link them to things like our biology and natural selection as a creator of our minds and thoughts. The thoughts are well explained and the progression of the book is really quite good. I think if I had to sum it up for somebody as to why Buddhism is true, I could probably do a pretty good job describing the author's arguments. I hope and trust I will get the opportunity to do that pretty soon.I think after having read the book I'm much more curious and excited about my meditation practice. I think there's something to be said for observing oneself in a non-attached way in order to find out more about where your motivations and feelings come from. I think I mean this in a practical sense, but this book helped me fill in the more intellectual side of the equation as to why meditation is important. The fact that people have been grappling with these kinds of questions for hundreds, if not thousands, of years is incredibly helpful. The author does a great job bringing those questions and that search into a modern context.Really enjoyed this book right now.
Easily the best book that I've read this year. Highly recommended.It makes so much sense that someone like Michael Pollan would write a book like this. His previous explorations into food and food culture lend themselves well to the world of psychedelic chemistry and their impacts on the human mind. Much as food has a cultural and spiritual element attached to it, the same can be said for this class of substances that is both very mysterious and very misunderstood. The history of the exploration of these classes of chemicals is very interesting and quite eye opening to learn about given how hard the authorities and institutions of our civilization have come down on these materials. My favorite line in the book was where he described these substances as "Disruptive Technologies." This is accurate and probably why they were made illegal. Nobody knew quite where this particular disruption would lead.His descriptions of his experiences are vulnerable and interesting. Leading in to a discussion of what exactly is going on within the mind of people after taking a psychedelic, I found the book to be an exceptionally interesting read in this day and age. Currently exploring the realm of meditation myself makes me wonder about the Default Mode Network and how it affects my life. Much of this book is relevant to that.I guess it makes sense that so many people I know are reading this book right now. Lots of sense.
Fantastic book. Really interesting from start to finish. Tons of interesting stories and facts. It's a shame I probably won't be able to remember them all.
Solid treaty on the feeling of remorse. A bit sad and depressing but hits all the right notes for what it's going for. Makes one think about all the flippant things one might have done to others in our youth and where that could lead. I'd recommend this book as it's short and quick to read, but packs a wallop.
Really enjoyed this one. Great mix of science, philosophy, nature, evolution and consciousness discussion. Easy to read too. Recommended.
Great Read! Nice little detective story with some side ramplings about one's internal / meditative / buddhist state. The main character has Tourette's and his internal dialogue is really quite the dance. I am looking forward to seeing the movie and I've enjoyed listening to some other thoughts on the book. Recommended reading.
Good presentation of Joel's story and his predictions for the future of Clean Money, which is basically any kind of financial alignment towards mission based capitalism. Really good book for me to read at this time and there are a lot of good examples and things to think about in order for someone to activate their personal holdings in the pursuit of a mission. The world is changing. Are human systems changing with it? Let's hope so.
A nice little guide to the new world of Big Data and how it can be used to measure a new type of sociology by being able to dig in and focus on interesting tidbits of data related to the massive numbers of users on google. Not really too much notable here. It all makes sense, and it's definitely some kind of cool.
Super fascinating book. I thought it was a bit tough at first and I wasn't super excited about it, but boy did I tear through the last half of it. Incredibly compelling story behind the CIA using mind control drugs in the 50s and 60s, eventually discovering LSD, and then it eventually finding it's way out into the collective consciousness, as it were. So many fascinating characters weaved throughout. It did seem like such a chaotic and disruptive time and I can't imagine all of the psychedelic drugs really helped people get through things in a straightforward way. However, one of the most compelling concepts in the book is that of LSD as an amplifier, so all of the hardship and generational changes of the times were already latent in the people. The drug just made things come out a bit more quickly and also burn out a bit more quickly too. Maybe? Sounds like a decent theory in any case.
One of my favorite science fiction books ever. Particularly liked the chapter about the futility of thousands of years of research on Solaris and how the great squandering of human talent on it. Not sure why I like it, but maybe it's because it demonstrates our insignificance in the face of an entity which is much more advanced than we are, and perhaps our insignificance in the face of god.
Very cool historical biography of the Comic Artist Charlie Chan Hock Chye. Set against the backdrop of the development of the modern city state of Singapore, this is a hybrid comic mixing some of the artists original work with biographical pieces by Sonny Liew to flesh out the story. I learned a lot of stuff about Singapore, which was cool as I read this while I was there. There was a video I watched in the Singapore national museum which pops up a couple of times here in this book and I think I’ve gotten an interesting insight into the emotional moments that defined the country at the time. Near the end of the book, I found Charlie’s Days of August comic to be a really incredible idea and execution, bordering on the sublime. Probably because it cribs from Philip K Dick’s Man in the High Castle, but it takes a bit beyond when the two main characters (including the author) go back in time to Pre-modern Singapore.I can’t really speak highly enough of this. Probably the coolest thing I’ve read all year. I wish more people were making comics like this.
Most of the beginning of the book didn't seem that interesting. It was just a summary about the current state of the art of AI and some of the doomsday scenarios and arguments being prepared for the future of this technology in society. Given that I'm a sci-fi nerd, I was already pretty up to speed on this stuff.However, once the author started to get into Provably Beneficial AI Principles then I was quite engaged. It seems like a really. interesting framework for thinking about how we should allow machine agents to represent or do work for humans. I'll keep thinking about it and learning more.
comprehensive and compelling history of the food industry. My favorite parts were about the original industrialization of the food business in the US in the late 19th and early 20th century. Reading all of the stories about the change in management culture and philosophy at that time makes me think a bit more about where we are with capitalism today.Of course, one can't read the book without thinking that the modern food industry is killing people. I'm not really sure if this is because blame is to be placed on the food industry, or if this is just the modern state of the world's capitalism applied to something that needs to be consumed constantly every day. Regardless, it's an interesting history to read about, but because there is not a single coherent storyline to follow I found I finished reading it just to get it done.
Loved it. I enjoy David Mitchell and I wish more people were writing more literate fantasy.
I quite enjoyed this one. It's been a while since I have read short stories and I forgot how nice and light it is to have a fresh start every day.Once again, I like this author because the writing seems to be so simple and yet so visual. Maybe that's because it's translated although I have to think that much of it comes from the original simple descriptions of situations and objects. While this isn't quite as psychedelic as some of his other books, it still got a bit looser towards the end, even including a very interesting riff on the famous Franz Kafka short story about the man waking up one day as an insect. I very much enjoyed that and the final piece to finish it off.Probably one of the favorite contemporary authors. Already looking forward to reading whatever he comes out with next.
Solid! So many things come together in such a wonderful way in this book. It's a biographical history, but does such a great job of capturing not just the world in which Joseph Conrad came of age but also in giving the flavour of his fiction throughout. I'm a fan of Conrad's, from when I first read Lord Jim when I was 21 or something. I've since read most of his major novels and now reading about his life I feel like there are some of the books that I should probably re-read.Regardless though, this book which has a view of the globalizing world of the late 1800s is definitely worth reading today.
Possibly one of my top three favorite books this year. I read it while I was at the beginning of my 2018/2019 ski season in Whistler, which probably adds to the background and context within and outside of the book.I loved the description of the logging industry in BC as it developed. The types of people it attracted, the towns it developed, and the kind of culture and terminology it minutely injected into modern culture. It's such a tragedy to think about a tree that's been growing for 800 years and that it takes 6 men about 3 hours to cut it down. But all of them would say, "hey it's a job" and move on to the next. Maybe this makes me think a bit about modern capitalism. About the market. About the earth and how it's definitely not accounted for in every bit of math we do regarding building this thing called civilization. I'm a fan of civilization.Beyond the logging to the main story in here, it also makes me sad. It seems like such a completely misguided action carried out by a man with a mental illness, but really, are the loggers who cut down 800 year old spruce trees any different? Are we all just crazy at times? Isn't capitalism crazy? Humanity is craziness, because really we are also the only things that can define ourselves as being sane. It's the endless spiral. Order/Chaos. Sanity/Insanity. Destruction/Growth.This book is a really great real-life discussion of these kinds of things set upon the incredibly beautiful natural back drop of British Columbia. Great read. Totally recommended.
Finally finished this classic. Great books! Considering when they were written, it's not surprising to find out that there are multiple elements to the story here that have inspired so many other sci-fi stories from Star Wars to the Three-Body Problem. I really enjoyed it. Especially leading up to the ending. I can't really say much without giving away why I like it, but this trilogy is still worth reading in the 21st century if you can put aside some of the old-timey sci-fi vibe and focus on the intellectual ideas present in the changing of time.In any case, it's highly recommended to read.
Pretty great and overall satisfying conclusion to the Hyperion Cantos. Sometimes it's possibly a bit too fantastical and mythical, but there are really some incredible ideas and worldbuilding that have happened over these four books. Some of my favorite things include the unveiling of the startree, and the church as galactic empire. Those were my favorite sections to read in any case.I think what prevents this book from getting five stars from me is that it could have been a little bit shorter. The author is certainly taking a bit of a victory lap, which is justified, but there is some fill and fluff that could have been cut out I think.Overall though I'm going to be recommending all of these books to friends who like science fiction!
A good book. A classic. Worth reading for sure although I think just the experience of the camps itself can give you all that you need to get from it. Still, it was about time I read this one.
Super Enjoyable reading. The story of newscaster who had a panic attack on good morning america and how he eventually learned to tame the voice in his head and get his sanity back via meditation. Illuminating journey with a few interesting characters owing to the fact that the narrator is a newscaster. I am a fan of meditation already, so I didn't get that much out of it in that way, but I did find it very entertaining to read his story.
Quite enjoyed reading this one. Although it definitely is pretty clear that the writer honed her style over years at the New Yorker magazine.An interesting and informative look at the Los Angeles public library system within the context of a fire in the Central Library there in 1986. The book moves back and forth between the story of the library fire and chapters outlining fascinating bits of Los Angeles history and facts and figures about the library in the present day.Overall not the most exciting thing to read, but it's a book about libraries, so what is one to expect? I still think it's a nice way to spend some time. Also reminds me that I need to spend more time in more libraries. :)
I liked it overall though the writing was a bit weird. What's weird is that I normally like weird writing I think, but this one I would drift off and have to flip back for details.
Great read. Really enjoyed it. Not a ton of dialogue, but it was beautifully written and tells a compelling story about the early days of America in a mythical style. I think the idea that the protagonist can barely speak english really helps with the visual style of the novel.Highly recommended and I'll be telling people to read this one.
Great book, even though it could be considered a bit too long and perhaps a bit dense. The density of the characters and the prose did seem to work for me though because those courts and noble family intrigues are actually really quite complex! The author does a great job of not distilling that complexity too much and gives you a solid sense of how difficult it must have been to navigate those types of situations and networks. Especially for those that aren't very good at playing the game.I will most definitely read the second and third books in this series. I didn't really know much about the Tudor's but now I feel like I could possibly even be more informed than my mom who didn't read this book and probably watched all the movies and TV shows as well. Recommended if you like dense and hard to read historical english literature.
Great biography! A real page turner and a well researched and written look into the life of somebody who I felt like I grew up with and knew, but it turns out I actually didn't really know her. I enjoyed reading this on my christmas holiday.
Great sci-fi. Total Adventure. Well written and I was feeling the tension from the plot which kept me really into it. I'd recommend this book much more than I would Ministry For the Future especially for a new reader to KSR. Enjoyed it a lot.
The fun sci-fi wild space opera continues. This one has more of a huckleberry finn thing going on moreso than the canterbury tales of Hyperion. It's interesting and great imaginative fiction in an expansive and well realized universe. I am hooked and I'm really curious about how the next book is going to end this. Overall this is turning into one of my favorite science fiction reads.Recommended, but first read Hyperion of course.
I have always leaned a bit towards the doubting side on the environmentalist political and economical philosophy, so of course I relished reading this book. Anything written by someone with a history of environmental support and activism writing a book that, heaven forbid, goes against the grain and points out flaws in what's been the traditional view of the environment and it's place in the economy makes me smile a bit.I think there is a lot of material in here that helps the book be a bit of a guide to a certain point in time about 10 years ago and brings on many great case studies of things that could have been advocated for better in the past. The first chapter indicates the scale and scope of the then understood climate change outcomes and it seems really freaking scary. Going beyond this frightening estimation of the future of the planet and our place on it to take on nuclear energy, genetically modified agriculture, dense cities and other interesting things such as geo-engineering the planet, this book was quite enjoyable to read.For anyone who wants to become a bit more pro-science in their view of the environment and what's to be done should read this. I think I'll also use this as some motivation to increase my own knowledge of what's happening in the current world of science.
Fantastic book! I haven't read something this enjoyable (for a physics nerd like myself) in a very long time. The writing is clear, explanatory, literate and the plotting of the entire book is really well done. It opened my mind up to the concepts of time in a way that I had never thought was possible before. Some of the spiritual implication of time as a byproduct of consciousness are so fascinating that I'm probably going to be thinking about them for a good while into the (well, actually, my) future.Very highly recommended
Another enjoyable read from Emily St John Mandel. I really liked how this one tied into her previous novel, which was one of my favourites of the last few years. This one had a nice little time travel story and you can already see that she's trying to build her own 'multiverse' of sorts with all the short interactions with the minor characters as we go through it.I will definitely read whatever she publishes next!
Well that took some time. I haven't read a book quite this long for many years. I think the most interesting thing I realized while reading it was that the author was getting better at the craft as the book went on. The first 100 pages or so I was wondering why I was reading this and wondering if I would even finish it.All that being said, I did enjoy it and it will stick with me for a bit. There are some really great scenes in this book (Lancelot fighting the Pendaran forest monster for example) and lots of interesting characters, but I think there were probably too many characters. I also would have preferred the language to be a bit more descriptive. It's a fantastical world where the story is being told and I felt like the writing was very dry and only served to move the plot forward rather than fleshing out the world through descriptive language.All that said, this is still a good book, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it to anyone given the length
Nice literature review of Utopian art and thinking throughout the ages. Will be a good thing to have on my bookshelf for pulling other books off of the shelf on certain themes or thoughts I might have on the topic.
Enjoyed it. Great yarn, as it were, thought possibly a bit too long. I did enjoy all the thematic pieces that were brought together in the end. I'll probably be thinking about it for a night or two. I'd recommend this for someone to read who wants a book that's straightforward and personal.
Pretty great read. No wonder I see this book all over the place all of the time. It's just a good idea with a bunch of examples of it in action written in a nice and simple style. I think anyone who wants to get better at doing things in this complex world could use a checklist.
Not a bad bit of guidance for working remotely, but I feel like it is a bit out of date. You can definitely tell that this is from pre-pandemic times. Still there are some nice tips in here and it's a pretty easy and short read, which is nice.
Good life story. He certainly lived through some exciting times. I found the only letdown to be when he didn't successfully win his run for governor and he quickly gave up without a lot of justification and then went into a critical mode. However, some of the ideas about public / private spheres in the back of the book were good.
Loved it. Good thoughtful science fiction with a real human element in it, even though that human element is expressed from the viewpoint of an Artifical Friend. The sense of childlike innocence of the narrator combined with the mysterious unveiling of strange things happening in a near futuristic world all combined to give a really good sense of mystery around love and connection. I really enjoyed reading it and would recommend to anyone.
Great scientific history. Thoroughly detailed and tells a great story about something that's so fundamental. I knew I would enjoy this book, but I'm surprised at how much it got me thinking. Not just about the fundamental building blocks of our lives (which is basically everything interesting), but also about the incredible time we are at in our scientific development. Gene Therapy, CRISPR, Harnessing big data to map genotypes to phenotypes. It's all possible in the near future. Do we know how we are going to respond to it? I'm not sure. I've also thought a bit about the abortion debate after finishing this book. Kind of how Life/Choice are two simple measurements of a really complex issue in the way that progressive/conservative are simplistic endpoints of a really complex spectrum. I'm rating this as five stars. Well worth a read for anyone with a curious scientific mind.
A fun little science fiction romp, though I think there’s a bit too much action in the middle third. Perhaps it’s just me, but I enjoy the psychological and scientific aspects of this line of narrative more than I like the violent action. That being said, the idea of a drug or a technology that connects peoples minds is an incredible concept and the book ends with a great setup for an exploration of what those technologies will do to society on a wide scale. I will probably check out the future books in the trilogy at some point, though I still think this book is overall kind of weak.
Definitely deserves to be called a 'classic'. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this basically does what all good science fiction should do. It takes an idea and keeps on running with it in more clever ways as the book goes on. Add in some minor romantic elements and some commentary on humanity, the environment, war and the human condition and you got a winner. Great book.
Nice, tidy history of one of the most powerful forces in human social history. Some very interesting stories in here for sure that would probably be interesting to explore in more detail if one was so inclined. It's really quite interesting to think about how the company can probably be seen (now and in the future) as the most powerful force in history.
Not bad for Satire. It had it's bright spots, but I didn't find it as engaging as I would like. Perhaps also I don't share the American view on race quite so much, even though it is an important topic and this book deals with it in so many ways across the spectrum. So even though this wasn't one of my favourite reads, it definitely wasn't a waste of my time.
I do like KSR, but this wasn't my favorite book of his. It was too long with not enough really compelling plot to make it work properly. It was mostly just an overlong missed connection love story with some semi-interesting science ideas and essays on economics and technology mixed in.I kept wishing that this book was written by Isaac Asimov and was 200 pages long. However, I did finish it. Not sure I would recommend it though.(and I still love KSR).
Fantastic Hard Science Fiction!!I very much enjoyed every single story in here and I would easily recommend this to anyone who's the least bit into science fiction. So much creativity and of course, the scale is truly epic on all of the stories.Easily recommended
Nice short and simple book. Giving off vibes of Amsterdam and the surrounding areas for sure. A peek into a different time and different lives, which was kinda nice.It probably is better read in the original Dutch though.
Great book to read. Well written and I liked the second-person narrative structure with the story being told for the benefit of the Premier of China. I realized after I started reading it that I've already seen the movie, but surprisingly it was still an enjoyable book to read.Definitely recommended.
Pretty Hilarious. Near future tale of extinction and industry. I found it to be quite funny at moments. Great writing!
Totally entertaining series of short stories. Very much fits with my lifestyle right now in that there are a bunch of stories where the main character is kinda chilling without working at his job. Mainly because he's decided that he didn't want to be a lawyer or editor or whatever. Maybe it's an interpretation of Murakami's real life.I generally enjoyed reading most of these stories. Some of them very much so (On seeing the 100% perfect girl one beautiful april morning), and some of them were good but weird (Lederhosen).Gave it four stars because it's great and it's what short stories should be.
Great! Thoroughly enjoyable and follows along on a really interesting theme and idea. Well researched and very engaging. As one would expect from Malcolm Gladwell. I also enjoy that I've now been listening to his podcast for a while too. I can almost hear his voice while I'm reading the words on the page. It's great.Worth a read for sure.
Probably one of the most original fictional novels I've ever read. It's kind of hard to describe, but it's literally quite conceptual, which may sound like a strange thing to say, but that's what it is. This book even caused me to watch Jaws for the first time, which is a bit amazing considering how it was the original blockbuster film. However, I also remember reading somewhere that Jaws is considered the original "high concept" blockbuster film, so perhaps that was some inspiration for the author.In any case, I really enjoyed the book. Glad that the person who gave it to me did so. Highly recommended for someone who wants a bit of a mind-meltingly weird fiction in their diet.
Great! Really enjoyed reading this history. Compelling conclusions about the early dutch influence on American culture. It really does seem like there were so many points in the story where major changes could have been made that would have influenced the future country that would become the United States. Given my current situation and familiarity with the Dutch culture as well my interest in New York as a city, I really enjoyed this book.Definitely recommended if you like reading history books
Another entertaining romp through the present and the future and the past in all sorts of interesting connections. I actually really loved how the book ended up. Wasn't expecting that. However, most of the earlier parts of it made me feel like I had read them before. Perhaps it's not as startlingly original as the first two of what I'd consider his "trilogy". Still good, but enjoyed Sapiens and Deus much better.
I enjoyed reading about what some of these extreme athletes were doing and what their stories were, but overall I think the author is a little bit off-base about what's happening here. yes, there is no doubt that people who engage in extreme sports are probably entering in to Flow states when they are performing their crazy activities. Are the flow states what is responsible for their achievements though? I don't really think so. I think it's because people are trying some of these things for the first time and really, the limits will eventually be reached. Flow won't be able to surpass certain physical limits, almost certainly.I'm a fan of the concept of flow and I really like the idea that Flow is something that's now being appreciated as humans endeavour in ever more fields, but I think I would ahve liked a book that was a bit more specific about the use of flow in non-extreme sports contexts. Maybe that's just me not being an extreme athlete.
A scientific review of the current collection of experiences that seem to suggest that there is some aspect to mind and consciousness that is decoupled from the physical aspects of the brain. There have been quite a few recorded examples of things such as near-death experiences, out of body experiences, and general psychokinetic experiments that are really difficult to explain with the current practical worldview of the brain. The books is excellently written and seems to have lots of good references, which is probably essential.I liked the book, but found myself glad that it was short. There isn't really anything explanatory or of a substantive explanatory nature out there. It doesn't take risks. It's a collection of stories and anecdotes and some summaries about things that are hard to describe. I'm not sure where I sit exactly, but I do think there could be some possibility here. It would be really interesting if someone were to more rigorously experiment with some of these cases, but admittedly they are super difficult to test in an exhaustive scientific manner.
Enjoyed reading this classic story of escape and adventure. I found the story entirely believable, though I can maybe understand why some people would consider some of the story a bit of make believe. I mostly felt this during the narrators time spent with the Indians of Guajira. However, I still think it adds to the richness of the book. I also kind of wonder how Papillon was so able to have people help him so quickly in so many different situations, but perhaps that is just one of those mysteries of charisma. Some just got it.Overall though, I really enjoyed reading this while I was on my own little adventure.
The upstarts contains a solid telling of the history of AirBNB and Uber. I was pretty intimately involved with the Uber part of the story and I can say that the history there is very much accurate. I was also so focused on Uber at that time that I actually had no idea what was going on at AirBNB. The stories being told together in an intertwined way was actually perfect. These are really exciting times in the worlds of technology and commerce and this book captures that. I don't know what the future will hold, but the idea of the sharing economy is so compelling that it certainly is here to stay.
Thoroughly enjoyable. I have two copies of this book so I must have been intending to read it for a while, which makes sense. I can see why it’s considered to be the most accessible of Joseph Conrad’s fiction novels. It has a continuous buildup from start to finish. I was surprised that upon starting the second last chapter I was still wondering what would happen, but when it was all said and done then it definitely made sense. It’s such a weird title though, and the type of victory it could possibly be is completely the opposite. It’s something much more human than that even amongst all of the death.
Multi-generational literary fiction with a sense of place and society that I didn't really know about before. I actually was not aware at all of the racial discrimination and attitudes in Japan towards Korea. Probably because I'm an ignorant westerner, but this book places those things in a clear story about a family over multiple generations. I really enjoyed seeing things evolve and found the author made the book interesting and surprising throughout.Definitely recommended if you want some history with your storytelling.
Nice, simple, useful. Kind of like a light version of Malcolm Gladwell book, but much more practical. I found it a bit hard to finish mostly because I have trouble finishing most non-fiction. Once I've gotten the message then I want to hang up the phone, so to speak. However, the message at the core of this book is actually really compelling. It's interesting to think about one's life as really being a day to day bundle of habits. What habits we pick is something that we have control of and it's something that we can modify to live in many sorts of powerful ways in order to live a life that's a bit more in our control. Something like that.Really good quick read. Definitely I will look at the epilogue again in the future.
Pretty interesting view of history as something that happened to us vs something that we've done. I like the perspective
Quite a good collection of real stories. It always amazes me sometimes how reality can almost be crazier than fiction. Some of these stories are definitely epic in scope, while some of them are also more touching and may hit closer to home. I found the quality of the stories to drop off a bit towards the end of the book but overall it was a good read for someone who may be looking for a diverse set of perspectives and thoughts on the ways that real life is crazy for us all.
Really enjoyed this read. I think she might be my favorite contemporary novelist. Definitely my fav Canadian one.I like all the connections made and not made between the characters. I was interested in all of them even until the very end. Something about a Ponzi scheme as the central core of the plot is really interesting. Who really knows what is true in the end, and we only have our experiences and stories to go on.Highly recommended and I think I've already loaned my copy to somebody to read
Very interesting read on a topic that I'm exploring and thinking about more and more often. This book offers a bunch of interesting vectors of thinking about philanthropy. Many of them are beyond the individual question which is always asked about whether a person should give (yes of course), and what that person should be giving to (things that will be effective). Instead, this book offers a discussion of the larger question of philanthropy and how it might or might not fit in our current modern manifestations of society.While reading it I flip flopped back and forth between 'philanthropy bad!' to 'philanthropy good!' in my head. This maybe makes it seem like there wasn't a cohesive conclusion to be drawn from the book, which could be seen as a problem with it, but I kinda like reading something that is meant to be almost entirely a discussion of various points and their pros and cons. These different perspectives will help guide my own into the future. Definitely worth reading if you're interested in society and you're thinking about your role with philanthropy as a part of it.
Some very solid literary fiction. So literary that there are probably a few things that I won't pick up without having read some other reviews. In any case, the book is a really nice meandering through a contemporary tale that then magically transforms to a fictional mediterranean past. It's also a retelling of one of Shakespeare's least known tales of a incestuous relationship between father and daughter. This is actually a pretty brutal way to start the book, but I really enjoyed reading it and following the thread that is weaved throughout the story that seems to follow all of the various female characters through their locations and situations.Definitely recommended if you like history, magical tales, or you're an English Major.
Fun quick read about the bombing strategies and technologies used in both Europe and Japan in the second world war. Lots of interesting characters and pontification, as one would expect from Malcolm Gladwell. I also enjoy that I know his voice so well from the podcast that when I'm reading it sounds like him in my brain.Totally worth 5 stars.
Great story about tinkerers doing what they do best. Amongst my favorite things in the story are the use of the wind tunnel in designing the second version of the glider, as well as the acknowledgement that being smarter paid off more dividends than just putting a bigger engine in the plane.
Great read. Very thought provoking and I know a lot of people in my circles have been talking about this book for a while. All the chapters take a different angle on the current (American) 'system' of elite wealth and power and each is well thought out and quite interesting. Overall it paints a picture which is also fairly evident.I'm struggling a little bit with this book because it is so American-centric, but perhaps it is meant to be a wake-up call for those elites in America who should be more thoughtful about how they use their wealth.
Fun adventure. A bit too much on the fantasy side for me, but the plot was appropriately dreamlike and I wasn't quite sure how it would end even until the very end. I thought I had it figured out, but I was actually wrong. Overall a pretty easy read, but there was a lot of fluff in there that the narrative probably didn't need. Still, I did enjoy it overall.
To begin with, I'm a huge fan of trees in all of their shapes and sizes, so it was only natural that I was going to appreciate this book. I wasn't really disappointed but I was left wondering a little bit what the author's intention was overall in telling this story.So the one thing I can definitely say about this book is that it is beautifully written. I have never read anything else written by Richard Powers, but I'll definitely look out for some more. The right mix of poetry and narrative. I also loved the structure of the book. Being told somewhat in the form of a tree, although I didn't quite feel like the narrative strands matched up to the structure itself. All the threads were quite different and there was only one that really ended the book in a state of seeding something. Still, I enjoyed discovering where the book was going due to the structure.About midway through the story I was disappointed that it was going to be a celebration of the people who did damage in the name of the trees. I feel like glorifying these sorts of acts isn't really that great, especially since the justification for the acts is so emotional versus something that's so absolute. By the end of the book however, I was a bit more satisfied. Not with how the characters get treated, but in how the scope of time as man vs trees was addressed. I kinda think this book will draw different conclusions based on the political inclinations of the reader, but that is ok. I was happy with my personal outcome.So overall, a very nice enjoyable book to read, but not exactly the greatest book I've read this year.
I love a good framework and that's exactly what this book sets out to provide. STORIES as a way to determine how the time you are spending is the best for you to be happiest with your time. I enjoyed many of the descriptions of the different elements of the STORIES framework, though some of them I feel like I already knew. Backed up by interesting science and with some good exercises if you are so inclined, I would say this is worth your time to read in order to discover a nice shorthand for making other decisions about your time on this planet. Glad I read it and I'll keep the framework going forward.
A good read. A bit on the over-intellectual side but some thoughtful guidance for living life by remaining true to yourself rather than by all of the cruft that we build up over time in life. All of the 'shoulds' that we create for ourselves from our upbringing, our culture, our family, our friends, and our previous paths. Basically, in a nutshell, ambiguity and change is our destiny and if we embrace that and seek the future path which is to determine who to grow into the largeness of our spirit then we will be doing ok. Something like that. Thinking of my own personal situation, some of the guidance in here is quite good.I probably wouldn't recommend this to most people because it is a bit dense, however there is some great wisdom in there. I'll probably note a couple of the chapter titles in my mind for the future as I keep on keeping on with my life.
Fantastic book. One of the better ones that I have read this year.It's a perfect follow up to Sapiens in that the focus is on humans and how we are trying to continually make sense and come to terms with our existence. Now that we've somewhat, though not in an evenly distributed way, come to terms with solving the physical problems of how to live day to day, we are going to start focusing on the next level things such as our longevity, our health, and taking our consciousness to the next level.I'm still not sure if the final chapters leave me feeling a bit scared for the future or just a bit disappointed. If we are simply conduits for data flow, then what does it mean for the emotional coloring of our future? But maybe we've always been flows of data and the emotional coloring is just something we live in now and think important, but maybe it isn't.In any case, thoughtful reading. I quite enjoyed it
Short essay on Wall Street as a concept that tries to go into what the financial capital markets are and why they are important. It's actually a really simple thesis and the autheor does do a relatively good job of explaining it. The financial markets are the reason our societies can be so productive and make the most impactful use of our resources. This is true and I don't think many people think about it that way. For this reason the book is good.However at the end of the book it's just a long rant about regulations. I kinda get where he is coming from. The regulations are a burden on an important industry, but that industry itself hasn't really done itself any favours in the PR department recently, so it's not surprising that there are currently regulations.Unfortunately, the author's proposed solution of just cutting all the regulation isn't really that constructive. I was hoping for something more.
Enjoyed this one. Of course a bunch of it is stuff that I already knew, but my story with Uber was already completed by the time most of the juicy stuff in this book occurred. It's actually quite the bit of epic corporate drama at the end and I do have to admit I was quite curious about the details. I got some of what I wanted and some was still left as a mystery.However, I do really like that this book didn't seem to have too much of an agenda. It praised the company for what it had done while also showing some of the downsides of how the team was built and managed. I was expecting it to be a lot more of the latter.I'm not really sure how someone who doesn't really know the story will react to reading it, but I'm sure I'll found out in the future.
This book definitely cemented my status as a Murakami fan. Probably the best book of his that I've read and that's saying quite a lot (I've enjoyed everything).Once again, I wonder how they get such a magical translation for the words and stories being told here, but I think it must just be an example of his clear thinking and simple writing style.Still, this is such a winner. I'll always be thinking of water and wells...
Another really great read this year. Seems like there are a lot of really interesting and thought provoking books coming out these days. That's a great thing.This one was quite interesting, although it was also pretty straightforward. I think, if you look at what the rules are basically getting at, there is enough common sense to realize why the author recommends the rules. The meat of the book,and what makes it so enjoyable (at least for me), is in the Author's rambly style covering all sorts of things that contribute to his world views on why a particular idea or thing are worth considering. Much of the biblical topics were incredibly interesting. I had never really thought of biblical stories as being relevant because they were passed down from ancient peoples and then eventually put into words that set in stone those ancient meanings. It's a very cool supposition and I'm going to continue to explore it, but I'm sure there are so many ways that someone could poke holes in this. Still, I enjoyed this one. It's big and difficult and has some good reasonably defended advice for living. Is it controversial? I suppose it's supposed to be, but I'm glad someone is doing something controversial. It would be a bit boring and we wouldn't be able to grow as a culture if it wasn't.
I think the quote on the back of the book about not being able to forget this one is totally accurate. It makes sense that this is a cult classic and belongs in a list of great american novels. The main narrator is a forever 'fan' in a wild and crazy postwar america. His struggle is all about not being a celebrity and not being a success which is something he just expected to happen. I guess there is an American obsession with being rich or being famous which is what has been driving this particular individual to mental institutions and years of heavy drinking. A sad tale, but a wonderfully written one to be sure.Not to be forgotten and recommended for a thoughtful time in someone's life.
I liked the book overall. Perhaps it's the EE that I am, but I most enjoyed the sections about the history of the telegraph and the telephone. Of course all of the stuff about Claude Shannon is top notch. The later chapters where the author attempted to move information theory into the realms of biology, quantum mechanics and the internet were also ok, but kind of make the book feel a bit more loose then it could have been. Still a great read though.
Interesting read about a real surly mofo of a character. At least from what it sounds like reading the book. It is an interesting case study somewhat, but I don't really find some of these kinds of people all that interesting. Always taking the same vacation, same route to work, same lunch, same coffee, etc etc etc. Reminds me of a convo I had with a friend recently about a family member who just works non-stop and eats at Olive Garden for lunch every day. What makes these people into these people I wonder? This book was an interesting read, but I think it could have been better with some more backstory on Bill Gross to explain his character. The later chapters of the book were certainly interesting and well paced, but it did just feel like a play-by-play. I don't think I understand these types of people better after having read the book.
Very sparse and matter-of-fact telling of his personal tale during the Genocide and Civil War in Rwanda in the 90s. Factual, brutal, and makes me sad to think about how this could possibly have been prevented.
Super fun and easy read with all sorts of great little bits of stories and useless knowledge. Many weird facts that just make sense when you dig into them. My only small complaint about the book is that I want to tell everyone every cool little thing that I read in there, but it's hard to remember anything because there's so much of it. This might be an ideal book to put in a accessible bookshelf that's a bit more accessible to a temporary user who can immediately share. At least that's what I'll do.Totally worth flipping through though. Super interesting book.
I think it's great that Bill Gates wrote this book. There are likely a bunch of folks who will read it who will realize what kind of situation the world is in. In fact, when I started reading it, I got the impression that Bill was actually kind of dumb for such a smart guy. A lot of the book will be valuable for people that don't understand the problems for sure. By the end of reading it though, I wasn't really learning anything new.What I did think was interesting was the concept of Green Premiums as a way of thinking about new technologies, plans or processes related to climate change. It's a good tool and the best thing I got from the book. It didn't require the whole book to get it though, but it is still good.
Fascinating life story of a fascinating character who lived a pretty interesting but also absolutely insane life. It's kinda no wonder that he started to crack near the end. It's a tough reminder that even though you're seen to be successful, it doesn't always mean it's easy. Worth reading.
Dark and funny and kind of interesting. didn't really go anywhere, but I didn't really expect it to. I always wonder if books like this (and catcher in the rye) are popular because people see a little bit of themselves in the main character. I did like the mixture of drab commentary and internal strategizing on even the smallest bits of conversation that the protagonist was involved in, though I do think it sure must be a waste of human effort to be doing that all the time. Maybe that's what the book represents to me then. I enjoyed it, thought it was interesting.
Overall a pretty fantastic book. I really liked it. I'd probably give it a 4.5 out of 5 if I could because even though I loved the structure, the writing, and just general the era and the characters from the book I don't think it quite reaches masterpiece status with the plot. However, it is still phenomenally good and I'm excited to read more books by this author for sure!
Fun book for sure. Some very interesting stories and facts in here. It would be interesting to know how much a non-technical reader would enjoy. I'd recommend it, but probably not to a big computer nerd like me. Still there are some fun things in here.
Quick read. Good themes and a little bit new agey hand wavey but I still liked it. Has given me some good ideas.
This was an interesting read for sure. I'm not sure why, but any time I've ever read any Dutch fiction, it always seems to skew towards the dark and psychological. This book did a very good job of adjusting the viewpoint of the reader and the narrator throughout the book. I can't really say much more, but I did find myself thinking about what "the Happy Family" means after I've finished it. Definitely a book that could stay with me for a while. Super quick read too.
Interesting read, but probably I could have read the Atlantic article and gotten all the information I needed from that. Still, there might be some good tips for people with children or considering a university to apply to in here.
Great read! I enjoyed this one immensely. Lots of interesting stories and thoughts to back up the perspective and thesis of the Author. I think I do enjoy being much more of a generalist myself so am happy to see that way of intellectual life being celebrated. Of course, the specialists are out there and continue to be necessary, but this isn't the only way to define success.
wait what? not ok.
Fantastic book! Really inspiring. I almost feel like this is a bible that describes the way I've been living for many years. Maybe I've been lucky to stumble upon some of these ideas myself. I have been recommending this book to others in the hope that they can use so many of the lessons in here. I do also like that the context is within a symphony orchestra. Really nice.I will recommend this book to as many friends and colleagues as I can. It's really great stuff.
Seriously great historical fiction. I wish I spoke Italian but the translation to English didn't seem to lose any of the lush description of the period of time the book takes place in (1860s Sicily). If I closed my eyes I could almost see myself within the walls of the Palace and the Country estate.The book is a tale of family, love, loss and coming to terms with a new era in the history of the world. It's basically a costume drama set over the course of 10 years. Highly recommended. I read it pretty quickly when I did have time to pick the book up.
Nice to take a dip back in to some classic science fiction. It's always kind of interesting to read these books where the setting is quite far into the future yet the technology is some sort of quiet evolution on what we currently have or will soon be having. I always wonder what these books would be like if rewritten to include smart phones.Anyways, the story is more philosophical / political then it is plot driven. Although the main character is motivated somewhat by his family on his home moon (the anarchic society of Anarres), he is much more motivated in his quest for truth and justice across the entirety of the futuristic human race as depicted. I found the most interesting thought as I was reading it was how inescapable it is to be part of the entire human race and society. It's impossible to ever be truly free, whether you think it's possible to be free from force, you may never be free from belonging and social coercion.An interesting read, but I think I do prefer other works of this author.
thoroughly enjoyable dutch fiction classic. In general just a classic of literature. I really enjoyed it although I think the most value I got out of reading the book was about learning about Multatuli and the story this book has within Dutch colonial history. Seeing has how it was somewhat indirect impact on the idea of colonialism in general. This is something that I need to probably read more about.However, I'd recommend Max Havelaar and I'm glad somebody gave it to me to read.
The writing in the book got better as it progressed, but overall it probably could have been edited down somewhat. There's a lot of repetition and the book's author is obviously a bit new to the book writing game.That being said, I'm probably about as well informed about OCD now than I have ever been. It's an interesting story though, and I'm looking forward to continuing to explore it in other mediums.
Probably not the best titled book out there, though it was well written and relatively easy to read. However, it was much more about the Down than it was about the Upside, which is contrary to what I was expecting. The book paints a pretty dark picture of the society that we currently live in and how it's living on an extended complexity of energy picture. He contrasts this with a similar setup for the Roman Empire and we all know how that ended up. I do understand the need for resilience and redundancy very well so it's nice to see the author point those things out, but again, there aren't too many solutions or historical examples there for my liking.I feel like this book was likely written for a Canadian audience, particularly at a time when the Canadian economy was so much geared towards (And overheating because of) energy.
Fantastic. Literary. Diverse. Compelling. Readable.I thought this would be simple and trashy science fiction, but it actually turned out to be fantastic. I really loved it and was excited whenever I got a chance to open it again. I really liked the detective's story. The soldier's story was also kind of cool. It's amazing that the author was able to do so many genres so well.Highly recommended.
Worthwhile reading and many many good things to think about in one's life. A classic which has probably been recommended by others to me a couple of times in my life before now. I think this is a good book as a reference manual, given how it is written as a series of concise lessons within a larger framework of how to think about being a better man. I liked it and would recommend it. I hope to take it out and review it every once in a while into the future as well.
Quite possibly the best book that I've read this year. I struggled a bit in the middle, but by the time I was done, I knew I had just finished reading something really special. Highly recommended for the sly comedy factor as well as for the commentary on humanity and how silly it is.
Great read. No pun intended but I devoured it. All the sass and personality you would expect from Bourdain with a look at a part of the world that I guess I've always interacted with but never really thought about it before.
Love this kind of book. Some economics, some vision, some history. These are big ideas too, and while I have no idea which of them are actually practical, I do think it's important that someone is thinking about them and proposing them after some undefined step up from where we are now.Universal Basic Income, a 15 Hour workweek, and fully open borders. These are big ideas, with big consequences. Who knows which are realizable in our lifetime, or which ones are even realizable at all. Still though, even if these are not feasible now, it's interesting to present the ideas and to think about them. This will be the case well into the future.Super quick and easy to read too. Nice presentation and looks like it's reasonably well backed up by research and references. Highly Recommended
Solid, tidy conversationally written summary of the basic field of economics. Written from the perspective of someone who is most likely a libertarian. Was nice to get a survey of the field from reading this, even though I feel like I had a good grounding to begin with. Seemed like some of the examples were a bit old school and I wonder if all the things he talks about still totally apply in a much more modern economy, but those are thoughts for me for another time.
Nice read. Philosophical Manifesto with lots of interesting thoughts and art history within it. Probably much nicer for me to read since I did used to live in the Bay Area during a time in the past. I can visualize all the places that she is talking about. I do think the ideas she is proposing are very valuable and I also liked how she took the concepts beyond just 'disconnect from social media.' However her thoughts on social media, space, time, contextual understanding and rebuilding connection with context are really quite nice to read about and hopefully think about as I continue to go on about my days.
Wow I really enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. It's short and sweet with all sorts of really compelling thinking about the modern world and how to view and build into the future. Many times when I read non-fiction I find the books to be overly long and not very information dense (i.e. I could read a summary and be fine). However with this book I think it was short and dense and just right for a non-fiction book.Somehow I think this one will get pulled off of my shelf and referenced again in the future. But definitely highly recommended reading for anybody thinking about startups.
Overall a really good collection of Sci-fi short stories. The very first one is probably the most story-like and it’s a lot of fun and seems like something very classic. The stories that come afterward are much more like thought experiments with some attempted story being built around them. I did enjoy the titular story, as well as the author’s afterward. We are all basically living entropically and moving energy around, but in different ways. I’d never really considered food to be energy but in a highly ordered state, but I guess it is.Worth picking up if you like ideas.
Incredible book. Powerful mix of science and humanity. Highly recommended for anyone.
Great book. Very interesting.I bought this and decided to read it as a gift idea for progressively minded friends. Who knew that by the time I would actually be reading it that the FTX Crypto Exchange would have fallen and that SBF's support for Longtermism and William Macaskill would be covered in a completely different kind of light.All that being said, I really enjoyed the book. The sections on population ethics were incredibly interesting and I think so many of the other things that the author writes about resonate with me as well. I will definitely bring up this book and its line of reasoning whenever somebody tells me that it's not a good world to bring children into. I'm glad the author disagrees with that. I'll be continuing to think about this one for a while. And recommending it too.
Nice chill literature. About a board game. A game of Go. Even through the translation I felt the deliberateness of the writing and where the author's attention seemed to be. I really enjoyed it and would read other works by this author.
Very original graphic novel / comic book series. Actually it's quite hard to describe, but basically it's a family story set in a fantastical universe. The daughter of two soldiers on opposite sides of an endless conflict fight their way through all sorts of crazy situations to keep their family together while picking up a pretty wild assortment of misfits along the way.I enjoyed reading it, and the visuals are super colourful and weird, which I do like, but I have to admit that sometimes the story too often depends on the same sort of story elements. The number of panels where things are about to go completely wrong for the protagonists and then someone shows up from out of nowhere and saves the day is a bit unfortunate. Aren't there other ways to solve the problems.However, on the plus side, this is a really great work of comics art that probably can't really work quite the same way in any other medium. The way that the robots blast away their foes, for example, I thought was super fun and makes use of the flipped page.Overall I think it's a good one to read. Quite a good one, but it's not my favorite comic / graphic novel.
Not a bad survey of the current state of the art in non-ordinary states. Not much detail though. I would probably recommend this book to somebody who was curious about things like burning man and other conscious experiences but I may not recommend it to someone who has already been through a number of these types of experiences.Still though, a simple and quick read. Not bad
Nice read! Was a bit slow in the first half as it was all getting set up but I started to get drawn in further and further throughout the book. Multi-generataional history of Zambia which was cool for me to read after having gone to South Africa and Zimbabwe recently. Lots of familiar thoughts and feelings in reading it, but probably not as much as if I had gone and spent some time in Lusaka like in the book. I loved all the references to Mosquitoes which were an ever present menace during our trip and also for all the preparation time.Probably not a book for everyone, but I was looking for some longer form fiction related to Africa and this popped up just in time. Nice to read and it'll be interesting to see what she writes in the future.
Interesting historical reading. Nice take on the 20th century which was reasonably well constructed and quite interesting to read through.
thoroughly enjoyed this one. very human story in a solar system far beyond where we are now. I really loved the major event of 2312 when it finally happened because it makes all of the terrarria asteroids such a cool long term plan. I'm also fan of the hard sci Fi descriptions of terraforming techniques for all the different types of planetoids out there overall a very nerdy book but I loved it
Really great. Simple and pleasant to read, especially for a guy I think. The war setting doesn't really distract from all the life lessons both obvious and hidden that the main character finds himself going through. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a "manly" read.
Solid four stars, though I do think I wavered in my rating of the book as I progressed through it. The beginning was kind of interesting, though it kind of slowed down a bit. I then enjoyed reading about the early days of Silicon Valley. I didn't really too much like the sections on VR, strangely enough, but I loved two of the three appendices. Phenotropic (typic?) programming and the duel of the two modern demigods of technology and economics, which are basically choices we've made with how we are developing our technology with implications for the future. My favorite mental tickle reading the book was when the author talks about the twin future technologies of VR and AI and makes some analogies to physics in the form of the Quantum World (with Observer) and AI (with galactic scope). Maybe I just made up parts of that analogy, but anyways it's a cool thought. Overall a fascinating character and an interesting history. Writing could be a bit better and less wordy and then it would likely be a bit easier to follow, but it was an easy enough read that it didn't take too long in any case.
Very Philosophical and also quite opaque. Told from the perspective of a new friend in a bar/city/night environment over a few days, it's not very plot driven but there are some interesting turns of phrase in it. I think I have a bit of dfficulty with the main character as he is a bit arrogant with some of his observations.Still though, it is a thoughtful read. It's short so I could see myself having a look at it again someday.
Interesting, creative, and also somewhat impractical theoretical ideas abound in this book about how to more effectively use the power of markets. I actually have been thinking about some of these sorts of ideas for a while now, and it's nice to see someone lay out some more radical thoughts in these areas. The market based approach to valuing property was quite interesting, but I think quadratic voting was probably the most interesting form of governance. The idea of building up voting credit and being able to speak more forcefully on specific bits of ones preferred agenda seems like a really interesting way to vote. Maybe it's going to happen somewhere on some sort of smaller scale.Reading this book it was hard not think that this one will be looked back on in history. These ideas are definitely well before their time. Who knows if any of them will come to fruition. Maybe we still need to set up a new country (new planet) with all sorts of new rules in order to take the next step in the evolution of our species' philosopical economy.Still, this was definitely a worthwhile read.
I finished it! It was quite a long read. I don't know if I would have finished it if I hadn't switched up the translation I was reading near the beginning of my journey. My first sally into the world of Don Quixote, if that's a better way to put it.Overall I very much enjoyed the book. It was funny and engaging, even though a bit long winded at times. Although the longwindedness and some of the speeches some of the characters made were what helped make the book so funny. I enjoyed the different characters a lot, and I liked the way that they all felt archetypal somehow. Maybe this is because the book was written in a different time, though it still holds up well in today's time and place. In summary, this is still a worthwhile book to read and I am definitely going to be looking more for it's influences in all of the media that I consume probably for the rest of my life. So in summary, long, but probably worth reading. Get the right translation.
What a classic. I didn't think I would enjoy it quite so much since it's probably aged a bit, however I thought it was overall a pretty great read. It's long though, the entire thing. I'd recommend it to anybody that likes comedy and science fiction. The writing is quite funny and there are definitely some concepts which I'm going to continue to talk about with my friends, such as the leader of the universe who lives in a cabin far away so he doesn't get corrupted by people, and the universe's longest hardest party that sucks all the resources out of the planet that birthed it. Funny stuff.It also gets nicely touching and funny right at the end and I must admit, the ending was just about perfect. Wrapped it all up and tied it all book to the beginning of the book, which is a pretty funny setup to begin with. I'm super glad I finally got this one off of the bucket list. Huge!
"All of them began to laugh spontaneously, because they thought it was still last night while the people in the streets had the delusion that it was bright hot morning.""But the brilliance, the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of water seeping through, over, and around a dyke. It requires the united front of many people to work against it."
I have never doubted my own skills like with this book: both the style and the content. Didion has a way of looking at the way that I can only hope to emulate, she is sharp, observant and pensive at the same time. This set of essays is really timeless and I found so much of her analysis of what it is to be human to be relevant to so many aspects of my own life and the society I live in. I found myself skipping to the end of the essays because the date would always be at the end. I just couldn't believe they were more than 50 years old. A must read for anyone who's interested in journalism, short stories and essays in general.
WW1 has always been a distant thing to me. My country, the Netherlands, is mentioned exactly once: as a neutral country where deserter might try to go. WW1 has thus not been entrenched as well in the national memory, when you compare it to countries like Germany, Belgium, France or England. I was a bit apprehensive about the book at first. Might it be dated, both in style and insights about war? I could not be more wrong. It is a timeless piece and for the first time I really feel like I understood what the war was about. Or rather, how it cannot be understood. Still, it's not a drag to read. It is funny and lighthearted at times while not whitewashing the war in any way. A must read for understanding the horrors of total war, in this age of relative peace.
It was a really interesting read, taught me a lot about working class politics in both France and the rest of Europe. The parts where the author described parts of his youth, growing up in Northern France were fascinating, however, he also has a tendency to get sidetracked with very in-depth sociological and philosophical analyses. At times these were a bit hard to follow, even though I have a basic knowledge about Bourdieu, Foucault and Sartre, three writers that Eribon mentions often. The most interesting thing was, the way this book positioned itself in the "class versus identity politics" debate. The author shows how this is a false opposition, by combining his working class origins with his homosexual identity.
